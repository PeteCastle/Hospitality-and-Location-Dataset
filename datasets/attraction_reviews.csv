Aside from those who went there on their own or with their balikbayan relatives and friends. I’m so proud to say that after 50 long years, the retablo is still there intact as how I made it. Got lots of positive comments from friends re. not only about the retablo I did, but the entire religious collection housed in the museum. The only negative one is the lighting on the retablo. They said they cannot get a nice pic of it for lack of lighting. How I wish the museum can improve the lighting on the retablo itself.

He made sure the rest of the tour matched our expertise level.  He shared a lot of stories and bits of history as we drove along the mountain roads of Sagada and then going to Vigan.  He gave us enough time to prepare and even extended our check out time in some cases when we were running late for the next trip.

You could call this a form of ancestor worship, but it’s likely just as much about making a statement.  Many of the monuments are actually more like homes and have toilets, sinks and places where you can rest.

He is our national hero and he was executed in Bagumbayan (present-day Rizal Park) in 1896. He wrote two famous novels ... the Noli Me Tangere and the El Filibusterismo. Many are also quite familiar with and have even visited places associated with him (like his family house in Calamba, the place of his exile in Dapitan, his prison cell at Fort Santiago, Paco Park where he was originally buried after his execution, and so forth). However, a few bother to visit the exact spot of his execution located just a stone throw's away from his famous monument in Rizal Park. There's a lovely place built there with big bronze statues depicting his actual execution. It's a quiet and solemn place where one can sit down, pause for a while, reflect on the life of Rizal, and relax at the same time.

Cruz (right across Sta. Cruz Church aka Archdiocesan Shrine of the Blessed Sacrament) is not only beautiful, but is also a significant parcel of Manila's history. While the location is not original (since this fountain used to be somewhere in Legarda, then transferred to Balara for a while before it was finally placed to where it is now), it stands as a concrete reminder of the city's very first water system initiated by Don Francisco Carriedo y Peredo in the early 19th century. Old Manila lacked safe, clean and drinkable water supply at that time and a water system was very badly needed. Looking at Carriedo Fountain, which the public often overlooks and pays no attention to, offers you a glimpse into Manila's past. The carvings and the overall design are lovely!

I let Mabuhay Restop do the planning for us (4 adults and 3 kids). I just told them what we wanted and they began the tedious work of meeting our expectations. With the able hands of Mara, Darren, and, of course,  Rose (the tireless proprietor), our vacation was just too perfect - from the hotel accommodations in Makati, to the flight to and from El Nido, to our stay at El Nido Cove Resort, to our local tours in Metro Manila. There were a few snags which were not their fault,  but each time they came to the rescue even at an unholy hour.  It made me feel I have a personal butler at my beck and call. They really went above and beyond, so to speak. I won't think twice to have them do all our future vacations. And the best part is, they search for the best service at the cheapest price tag. How can you beat that?  So, I'm calling all my friends and those using this site who are planning on a dream vacation in the Philippines, let Mabuhay Restop do the work for you.

Wala ng space para napagsayawan sa harap ng stage. It is where we spent our valentines. Kaya may paevent sila. And luckily, and luckily our friend won to date Gab Lagman with VIP seat together with us. Ang saya. 100 pesos na beer, tig-isa kami ng friends ko. At nakalibre ng 3 buckets of drink. The music is fine, mapapasayaw ka talaga. At may mga artista na nagpupunta. Actually, puro young businessmen makikita at makakasalamuha mo. Yung mga bouncer, napakaapproachable at matutuwa ka sa kanila. Kasi isang beses, feelibg wasted na kami. Bumaba kami from VIP seat sa 2nd floor, para sumayaw at nakita ng bouncer na yung mga gamit , wallet at cellphone nasa couch lang, pinabalik niya kami para iremind na baka mawala. Masaya dito.

The course is short and a par 66 in total.  The tee boxes aren't the best maintained, but apart from a visual appeal, does it really matter?  Greens were hit or miss in terms of conditioning.  Fairways were generally in good shape.  Most holes are narrow and will test your iron abilities.  The caddies (all females) were pleasant and did a good job.  The greens fees were reasonable for Metro-Manila.  Large driving range with a few dozen points; putting green small.  Parking not ample but if you arrive early it's not a problem.

However, he locked the door when he left the bus to talk to someone on his mobile phone. So, the passengers who wanted to get in couldn’t get in. Two, the driver lets everyone in before collecting the fare. Better if it is collected upon entry so that helps regulate passenger flow. Better yet, prepaid tickets can be sold at the airport and just presented to the driver. Third, there is no exact departure times from the airport. This should at least be regular, even with some allowance for delays.

I just want to share my experience so you can better your service. I booked for an appointment tonight at 11:30. My masseuse was not smiling, which was okay with me because maybe she's tired or something. But when the service started, she did not wash my feet properly, there were soap suds after she washed and she didn't even dry it. She was very mataray when she escorted me to the massage room. The bed was so shaky and it creaks, (which defeats my purpose of relaxation, that's why I booked in the first place). Then there's a sick Chinese beside my room, he was coughing and sneezing non-stop. ☹😔 the massage was also inconsistent, when I was facing down, pressure was strong but when I was asked to turn, pagod na ata si Ate. I'm not sure if the masseuse is tired, hates her job, or is just a victim of poor labor practice in your spa, but the service she gave was really poor.

Children would smile and wave, some even running up to hold our hands. Every person we met was genuine and positive,  in spite of their plight. They lived with strength beyond words. Besides understanding the current situation, we also learnt how the government plans to construct a massive commercial mall on the land thousands of slum residents call home.

Edgar had good  working relationship with the staff.  He customized the rest of the tour for us after we had a really hard time trekking up snd down slippery mountain paths.  He made sure the rest of the tour matched our expertise level.  He shared a lot of stories and bits of history as we drove along the mountain roads of Sagada and then going to Vigan.  He gave us enough time to prepare and even extended our check out time in some cases when we were running late for the next trip.  The hotels in Vigan and Baguio were excellent, very comfortable after a lot of driving, walking and sight seeing.  Breakfast food in all hotels were excellent, they had American and Filipino choices.     Our family had a great time.  As per my request, Edgar stopped by the Parol store in Pampanga going back to Manila.  I highly recommend this tour of you would like a sampler of the North.  I agree it felt like we spent a lot of time driving.  An A-plus experience nevertheless.  More power to Ms. Judith Magayano for being so accommodating and answering all my questions when I was booking from the States, my hats off to Mr. Edgar Hisoler, for job well done.

There are two more companies and they are better (more leg space, all busses have seat bells, etc) and they take less hours. The problem with Okayami is that the bus driver stops to pick up people and packages along the way. On our way back we needed to catch a morning flight and the people from the office said that we easily would catch it. But from the minute we left Banaue the driver stoped every 10-15 minutes to pick people up and drop them. It took a lot of time. He even let a drunk local guy in the bus who seated in the isle next to us and behaved weird and fell asleep on our lap. After 2,5 hours  I told the bus driver that we needed to be in time in Manila and he lied about the arrival time. I called the head office and they lied about it as well. After I told them the ride should take 8-9 hours (which is on their website) they said:’okey I will tell the driver’. She did and after that he didn’t pick anybody up and we arrived in time.

Chef was also gracious and let us try some of her personal favorites of local crafted beers. We’re not huge meat eaters, so our personal favorites were the Ginataang Pinakbet (vegetables stewed in coconut milk & local spices-- even the garbanzos added a new texture memory to my taste buds), and the Bistek Tanguige (spanish mackerel marinated in soy sauce & calamansi). 100% YUM! <3",Oct 2022,,",23 October 2022"

After multiple phone calls to MD by my wife and several text messages we had to give up and book a last minute ride using Grab. Thank God for Grab or we would not have made it to the airport on time. This was a very disappointing moment in our trip mostly because we saw in this young man someone who we looked forward to supporting his business. Now I can only recommend that others avoid MD tours for their lack of professionalism and also for what appears to be that they won't return our money for services they did not provide.

The staff is friendly, the food was great and you'll want to eat even if you're not hungry as you get breakfast, lunch, snack time and then dinner.  One night costs 12,000 pesos which in my opinion is overpriced but you forget what you paid for once you step into the pools.  Our favorite was the warm pools.  There are different depths and designs of the pools, various in size and some surrounded by a waterfall system.  The walk to the hidden falls was really enjoyable and we saw a few new wildlife like various spiders and a lizard which was cool.  The warm pool is open 24/7 however it is not well lit at night so we were hesitant to stay for longer.  Also, they really are into isolating guests and there's no wifi and even cell service at times.

You will  travel by boat to get to the island with the volcano, and then you will take a 30 minute donkey ride up a hill to see the ""volcano""..not much to see but if you are into the journey and not the end destination, you should do this.

But the are a terrible company. Get transportation from other s,/Profile/Sherpa50907323951,Dave,1.0,"I was extremely satisfied with my pick up.. My plane was late and I found the driver as he was leaving the airport without me.. when it was time for my adjusted return flight transportation.... I WAS LEFT AT MY HOTEL TO FIND MY OWN WAY TO THE AIRPORT. For your own safety and planning, stay away from this Broker, they own no vehicles or drivers. They offer no satisfactory results when flight plans changed. I had to pay another way to the return flight. I got no refund nor thr fake voucher offer. Terrible company. Please save yourself some trouble, just stay away from this organization. Respectfully Submitted David T. Miller MA.",,,

But despite of having this situation, the PCGs (Philippine Coast Guards) who's attending and managing all arriving citizens like me are very professional. They manage to do everything/ procedures in a very systematic, smooth and easy ways. You can see a lot of them everywhere in the airport doing each designated job. They are very, very organized. And in no time I'm already in the bus waiting to be send to the allocated quarantine facility/ hotel. Kudos to all the PCGs, the airport management and to the Philippine government. Keep up the good work! ",,,
