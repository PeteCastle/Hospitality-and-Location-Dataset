I was then informed that the rooms on each floor ending with 39 are the largest rooms. Therefore, I strongly recommend you reserve those if possible (as long as I don't miss out as a consequence!).

The executive suite bathroom's shower caddy was missing, so had to put the bath gel, shampoo, etc on the floor. They have a coffee/tea station, but there was no electrical outlet there to plug the electric kettle -- so you had to plug it elsewhere and bring it back. Lack of dining table in the suite as well.

Room type : Double queen studio Pros. 1. Reception area is quite clean and comfortable. 2. Check-in was easy 3. Room was clean and comfortable, with just enough space. 4. Comfort room (or toilet) not too small 5. They provide 2 bottles of drinking water and a pack of basic toiletries (which I didn't use anyway) 6.

No window at all so it‚Äôs very depressing when you‚Äôre staying for quarantine and can‚Äôt go out. No electric kettle but can request a liter of hot water from the receptionist for 10pesos. The packed meals has a very small portion too, mostly fried viands, and no vege at all. Even the hotel‚Äôs menu (if you want to order) has a very limited selection.

Good thing the mall is just around the corner so i can easily buy food. The guard took care of my car tho, so thats a plus.

Cons: -Sadly No microwave in their Rooms for a 4star hotel. -I am bit frustrated with their WiFi always gets disconnected and a bit slow. ( 5mbps download / 0.80 Upload) -Flush could be better. -Refrigerator sometimes noisy due to the drip.  Maybe I can try to book here again and try their Foods and Resto and Spa. ,March 2020,/ShowUserReviews-g298573-d2366916-r751686692-Armada_Hotel_Manila-Manila_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html

My pleasant stay in WKH had complemented my three-day local getaway. The ambience of the hotel bears a resemblance to Spanish colonial architecture. Certainly, it must had seen much better days, as it is to some extent, an antiquated property in the ""centuries-old historic district surrounded by fortifications"". The old building though must have undergone renovations (e.g., bathroom marble walls and flooring which is appreciable).

She said our room is confirmed & all we have to do is show up.  When my husband arrived at hotel, we have no room reservation.  They also put us in a room facing very noisy road.  We barely got a good rest & sleep since vehicles were honking all night long.    Most disappointing stay in this hotel.

Whether it's fair to brand all the places here as such, Town and Country included is really up to the guest.  The hotel has rooms which will fit almost any budget.  If you're lucky to have a discount card, it's usually good for 20% off the normal price.  The rates are best during lean hours of 8pm to 5am and 10am to 3pm.

JMM Grand Suites,4.0,Dec 2019,A Great Location in Manila,"JMM Grand Suites is a two-minute walk to the Robinson Mall that has everything imaginable (including a grocery store). Most rooms have a view of Manila Harbor and a little balcony.  The building has excellent security and the reception people are nice and efficient. I saw from other posts that they require a 2,000 peso cash deposit (about $40 U.S.D), and perhaps JMM could make sure people are aware of this ahead of time, but it gets refunded upon vacating. I booked a one-bedroom apartment, and enjoyed the extra space. The queen bed was comfortable, and the small bathroom adequate (shower worked find). The kitchenette was sufficient, with a refrigerator and microwave (did not use the stove). The ""fitness centre"" was minimal, but at least there are two treadmills and free weights.",December 2019,/ShowUserReviews-g298573-d4014256-r734104705-JMM_Grand_Suites-Manila_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html

This modest hostel has three layers of gate system, added with CCTV cameras everywhere to ensure safety.   Don't expect much of the rooms, since they are quite the standard hostel room. Bunk beds with basic bathrooms, but at least they're clean, cheap and air conditioned. The good thing is they don't accept booking per bed, so you can avoid sharing a room with strangers. Even booking a whole room is not expensive, it would only cost around 1000 pesos (US$ 25) per night.  The manager was very helpful.

Reddoorz @ PIY Margal Sampaloc Manila,1.0,Jul 2022,Disappointing,"After viewing the property online I had high hopes. Upon entering the room, we were welcomed to the smell of urine and mould, along side a used condom on the floor, a leaky sink and no toilet seat. We quickly realised that the advertisement was all a lie.  Most of the staff were nice, however there was one male member who appeared to be trying is hardest to be un-accommodating. Refusing to let us reserve a room and hence giving us no choice but to check in at 7am and check out at 7am the next day. When leaving the staff laughed at my friend for asking reception if they could book her a taxi, telling her ‚Äújust go on to the street there is loads‚Äù.

But my heart truly belongs to the front office associate who assisted me with the check-in, the maintanance person for the roofdeck, and a waiter at Cafe Romancon, Jester.¬† My friend and I opted to have drinks delivered to our room, and he left his personal bottle opener keychain. That is going above and beyond his service.  Dinner was good (had the salmon), breakfast not so much. May have to do with us coming at the last hour. Hopefully in the future, food service will be consistent up to the last person there.

The couch doesn't convert to a bed and is neither long enough or wide enough for an average adult male.

Cheap and decent do not always go hand in hand. You either always get one or the other. Almost never both. Or maybe I'm just lousy at finding cheap and decent places to stay in Manila.   There are only a couple of reasons why you might find yourself staying in Sogo Recto.

Booked a Deluxe room at the Stone House a few days before my girlfriend and i left Sto Tomas near San Fernando City Pampanga. It was a bit hard for the taxi driver to find, but eventually we did and the staff were really great at helping with the bags and wheelchair. Got the key to room 511 on the 5th floor and got in the elevator which was a nice smooth ride and walked a short...ish distance to the room. As with other reviews here i will agree that the room was pretty small, and trying to fit 2 people on a single bed ( especially when one is a bed hog ) does not make for a good sleep. There was construction going on next door till late and back on again early in the morning, but",March 2017,/ShowUserReviews-g298573-d858127-r470783355-Stone_House_Manila-Manila_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html

Nirain Suites,5.0,Jan 2017,Had a great stay here,Good clean hotel in a good location near the zoo and close to Adriatico street and LRT taft street. Very friendly staff.

Nirain Suites,3.0,Jun 2016,No Restaurant,This hotel is absolutely need a lot of improvement..from elevator which is too small that if you carry a big sizes  luggage will have a hard time to fit them all in one ride..alley is dark they let them switch off the light during the day..if you need to dine in this hotel have no decent restaurant .they only have a small canteen which can served you combo meals..No wifi in every floor. No shower curtain. The place is also not ideal for easy cab/taxi ride. The only credit is the friendly hotel staff name Marie.,March 2016,/ShowUserReviews-g298573-d7890881-r386757397-Nirain_Suites-Manila_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html
Nirain Suites,5.0,Jan 2016,Unforgettable Experience!,"Ms.Roma, the front desk, was very friendly! Even their staff at the cafe and the securities gave us a great service. Room was spacious, super clean as well as their bathroom. There's a closet inside the room w/c is a good thing if you are staying more than a night. The bed is very comfortable also. The location is nice, close to 711 and market. Easy to find! They just need to improve their Wifi connection or better bring a pocket WiFi with you. But still, one of the best hotel. Don't forget to try the food in their cafe, it's so amazing! Super Worth it!",January 2016,/ShowUserReviews-g298573-d7890881-r342918800-Nirain_Suites-Manila_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html
Nirain Suites,4.0,Nov 2015,Good For Families,"This appears to be quite a new place as not even the local taxi and pedicab drivers knew about it. Nonetheless, it is quite handy for the bars and restaurants of Malate, such as they are these days.  The establishment is clean and tidy, and the staff are friendly and professional. We rented a family room, which was enough for four people. It was very spacious and comfortable. We would advise it to people looking fora little more space than the usual hotel room affords.  The price also included a standard Filipino breakfast in the cafe.",November 2015,/ShowUserReviews-g298573-d7890881-r326623536-Nirain_Suites-Manila_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html
Nirain Suites,4.0,Sep 2015,"New, well-maintained, and a relaxing stay","I got upgraded from standard room to studio room and it was awesome. I feel like i got my own pad with furniture and kitchen. This place is new, not so big but well-maintained, and there's a modern feel to it. The bathroom doorknob was broken during my first day but they quickly fixed it the next day. Staff are very professional and there's 24-hour security and front desk.  The location has its pros and cons. It's very accessible since its near Quirino Station of LRT-1 but it's also in a kinda dingy place in Malate near residential areas. It's a quiet location though.",August 2015,/ShowUserReviews-g298573-d7890881-r306582754-Nirain_Suites-Manila_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html
