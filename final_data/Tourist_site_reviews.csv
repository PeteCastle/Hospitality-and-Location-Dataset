The third floor looks over the old senate chamber with a history mural of the Philippines. The top of the chamber alone is worth going. There are relief statues on every wall. Very interesting. Also the oval stair case if fun to look down from the top floor. One of the low /high points is the room of terror as I call it where paintings of the Horror's of the Spanish atrocities  are so vivid they will haunt you for days. In the same room there are paintings that show the brutality and destruction of wars. Overall a nice afternoon. I learned much from the visit.,May 2022,,",28 July 2022"

Aside from those who went there on their own or with their balikbayan relatives and friends. I’m so proud to say that after 50 long years, the retablo is still there intact as how I made it. Got lots of positive comments from friends re. not only about the retablo I did, but the entire religious collection housed in the museum. The only negative one is the lighting on the retablo. They said they cannot get a nice pic of it for lack of lighting. How I wish the museum can improve the lighting on the retablo itself.

On the second floor was a showing of several artists. A few that will stick with you for the rest of your life. For instance one artist forgive me I don't know their name but forever I will think about the heart display. Made from the burnt wood of the Australian fire is a matrix of wooden hearts. This is a reference to our own death, from the Egyptian book of the dead. The docent explained to me that at death each heart is weighted and to pass to the next life a heart weight exactly the same as a feather.  Each soul's heart must be not be too heavy or too light. It made me think for sure. It was quite moving. Another artist provided a glimpse of death as well with a living piece of the earth. The piece of earth that sits above your coffin, I happened to be there when she was bringing in fresh plants to plant. Like someone tending the grave of a love one after they were gone. Overall many treats to see in the place. I would love to see the theater when it is open. I hope they begin having plays there soon. And get more artists to display there works there.

The place was exactly what everyone said: good view! That basically is what you're paying for.  There's a mini mall close by with a Starbucks (not the one with the good view but a normal one), Nuat Thai massage,  supermarket,  pizza place, Samgyup, Hap Chan, appliance centre, local bakeshop. Across the hotel you'll find more restaurants and a Gerry's Grill. There's a condo unit by SMDC beside the hotel too, where there's a 7-11 and Ace Hardware. Sky Ranch is within the area, but it's quite a long walk. Location-wise, pretty ok but you'd still need a car to take you to the tourist places of interest. The hotel is grand, with a lot of function halls. Staff is friendly. The room is spacious, but needs freshening up. The wardrobe smells moldy so we didn't use it, the sheets are torn at the corners. The aircon only cools up to 22'C, so it was colder outside and we opened the windows instead. The breakfast was ok; no bacon but local stuff like tocino, sweet sausages, etc. They have a pool, but no one swims in it, as it's not temperature controlled. The lift is surprisingly warm, no ventilation.

But, I wanted to walk to the end of it slowly and look back at the island to see what Gen MacArthur must have seen and felt when he stepped onto the PT boat.  From the end of the dock you can see Cavite and Mariveles.  The trams that give the tour are rapid paced so I was unable to spend much time near the islands north dock.  My next point of interest was the Malinta Tunnel east entrance.  Good tour but the tunnel is darkened for the video effects and many tripping hazards from old rail tracks down the middle.  If you tour try to be near the front so you can hear the tour guide.  My interest from the 3rd tunnel lateral on the north side from the east entrance.  This was the Headquarters lateral for MacArthur and Gen Wainwright.  Several of the Laterals have life-sized people and scenes to exhibit the events of the time.  The experience is heighten by the flash and thunder of simulated bomb explosions, the soft hushed murmurs of people talking.  Wish I had more time in the tunnel itself, but it is a tour in and out .  Lunch for the tour was on the Islands only hotel, it was very very hot day the restaurant and loads of cold water and a buffet type food  After I attempted to follow the Bataan Death March route from Mariveles back to Angeles City, it is not well marked and the road is under reconstruction.  I want to go back and attempt that route after doing more research and putting some Lat's and Longs into my Garmin.  ""When I return"", I want to spend a night on the islands hotel and see in more detail what is called TOPSIDE.  This place was on my bucket list and it was emotional to walk where the US soldiers were from December 1941 till March 1942.  The tour guide had excellent knowledge of the island and the period in history that I was interested in.",Jun 2019,,",17 May 2020"

TheThat we purchased there for 750pesos. Big enough to seat 2 on it, then it was onto the wave pool that blurts a siren every 30 mins. That it's starting. Then you see all the young ones and teens running to it to get in the pool, as the waves pour over them. As it was a Saturday it was packed with people. We wanted to hire a Nippon hut. But all were took. We I'd get a picnic table which was sheltered from the sun. You see the local Philippine people with big trolleys full of food. Water containers. Bbq coke. That spend all day there. And use the large bbqs that are there free to use, it was only 170peso to get in for as long as you wished to stay.  Between 8&5. Then they do a night time swim. It's clean well maintained very friendly staff. Plenty of life guards around the 6 pools. They have shallow toddlers pool. To adult pools. They have a large pool with water slides. And water structures spraying or shooting water out,hours of fun. Very safe for children. Clean showers and toilets, when you first arrive at the water camp it's hard to  believe that behind the poor run down homes and buildings there is this hidden gem. A oasis waiting for you to discover. And won't break the bank to take a family.

We were having our company planning session with our office mates in nearby Amadeo, Cavite last July, when we decided to drop by Mahogany Market in Tagaytay for our lunch. It's been almost 5 years since I set foot again on Mahogany Market and oh my... things have really changed in Mahogany Market ... for the better. Since our budget-conscious group was looking for a good place to have our fill of ""bulalo"" (the  flavorful soup made from Batangas beef shank and marrow bones), without emptying our pockets, we proceeded to the 2nd floor of the meat section of Mahogany Market. This is the Mahogany Market version of its ""food court"". This is supposed to be ""the place"" for freshly-cooked affordable ""bulalo"". We were not disappointed.The place was clean and lined by food stalls offering Filipino food specialties including the 2 Batangas food staples: ""bulalo"" and ""crispy tawilis"" (small freshwater fish found only in nearby Taal Lake), just the right food to give warmth to the body while enjoying the cool weather of Tagaytay. The place was teeming with hungry tourists who were comfortably seated in several wooden tables positioned in front of the eateries, with each table topped with a big bunch of ""señorita"" bananas (the small banana variety found in Cavite which is known for their extraordinarily sweet taste, soft creamy flesh, and very thin skin). The bananas are free and so is freshly brewed coffee, made from ""barako"" coffee beans (a strong coffee made from Liberica coffee beans), just to whet the appetite. Since our group of 12 people were all tired and hungry, we managed to finish the bowls of ""bulalo"", ""crispy tawilis"", and tons of hot steaming rice in no time, with native vinegar, ""Siling Labuyo"" (small chili peppers native to the Philippines), and ""Calamansi"" (Philippine lime) on the side. After that ""feel happy"" lunch, we went down to the ground floor of Mahogany Market to buy some goodies like dried fish of various varieties (including dried ""tawilis""), salted eggs, watermelon, and native sweets like the native ""bandi"" (disc-shaped sweetened peanuts), to be eaten or to be brought home as ""pasalubong"" (take-home gifts). Fresh beef can be bought at Mahogany Market at relatively lower prices. The beef sold here are so fresh that they really look and smell fresh, no doubt about it. You can see beef being delivered every half hour and buyers, including tourists, flock to the stalls to buy freshly-butchered beef. ""Bulalo""... food items... fresh beef... That's not all that Mahogany Market has to offer. The street on the back or the northern side of Mahogany Market is lined with vendors selling plants, particularly fruit seedlings which are a goldmine for tourists who are fond of growing trees and plants for their home gardens. I had some interesting finds: jackfruit, grapes, mangoes, lychees, rambutan, longan, oranges, etc. I told one of the vendors to reserve some dwarf lychee seedlings for me when I come back.  The visit to Mahogany Market took around 2 hours but it was worth the time. Despite the long travel time from Manila ,I would definitely come back next time to Tagaytay, but this time with my family and yes... visit Mahogany Market.

Aside from the scheduled activities, we got to experience movie watching under the stars on our 2nd night, the kids got to ride a cart pulled by their resident carabao (a special request).  And just every free time was spent either swimming, flying kites, and running around the garden.  I was so confident to let them do so because the place is very safe.  I was also worried about my parents' mobility but the whole place was strategically planned that we had no problems moving about.  Also, the staff would make sure to bring to them whatever they needed if they were either too tired or feeling weak.  We felt so pampered in the place.  The time we were there was well spent... we got our needed relaxation and enjoyment for the kids, that when it was time to go my son was teary-eyed.. :) he said he was missing the place already!

Aguinaldo Cavite but our friend's dad voluntered to be our driver. He dropped us off at the barangay hall in Lumipa and from there we hired a tanod to guide us (paid P250 for a group of 10 people). Some of our companions suggested that we go on our own (thank goodness we followed our instinct and decided to hire a guide instead). The trail involves a steep descent and plenty of boulders. After 30 minutes of walking and hopping and trying not to fall, we finally arrived at our destination. We bathed for 2 hours and left before 6pm.

The place was exactly what everyone said: good view! That basically is what you're paying for.  There's a mini mall close by with a Starbucks (not the one with the good view but a normal one), Nuat Thai massage,  supermarket,  pizza place, Samgyup, Hap Chan, appliance centre, local bakeshop. Across the hotel you'll find more restaurants and a Gerry's Grill. There's a condo unit by SMDC beside the hotel too, where there's a 7-11 and Ace Hardware. Sky Ranch is within the area, but it's quite a long walk. Location-wise, pretty ok but you'd still need a car to take you to the tourist places of interest. The hotel is grand, with a lot of function halls. Staff is friendly. The room is spacious, but needs freshening up. The wardrobe smells moldy so we didn't use it, the sheets are torn at the corners. The aircon only cools up to 22'C, so it was colder outside and we opened the windows instead. The breakfast was ok; no bacon but local stuff like tocino, sweet sausages, etc. They have a pool, but no one swims in it, as it's not temperature controlled. The lift is surprisingly warm, no ventilation. All in all, average stay, meets your basic needs, and again, you pay for the view of Taal in your room and the Sky Ranch at the hall.",Jan 2020,Couples,",10 January 2020"

We were having our company planning session with our office mates in nearby Amadeo, Cavite last July, when we decided to drop by Mahogany Market in Tagaytay for our lunch. It's been almost 5 years since I set foot again on Mahogany Market and oh my... things have really changed in Mahogany Market ... for the better. Since our budget-conscious group was looking for a good place to have our fill of ""bulalo"" (the  flavorful soup made from Batangas beef shank and marrow bones), without emptying our pockets, we proceeded to the 2nd floor of the meat section of Mahogany Market. This is the Mahogany Market version of its ""food court"". This is supposed to be ""the place"" for freshly-cooked affordable ""bulalo"". We were not disappointed.The place was clean and lined by food stalls offering Filipino food specialties including the 2 Batangas food staples: ""bulalo"" and ""crispy tawilis"" (small freshwater fish found only in nearby Taal Lake), just the right food to give warmth to the body while enjoying the cool weather of Tagaytay. The place was teeming with hungry tourists who were comfortably seated in several wooden tables positioned in front of the eateries, with each table topped with a big bunch of ""señorita"" bananas (the small banana variety found in Cavite which is known for their extraordinarily sweet taste, soft creamy flesh, and very thin skin). The bananas are free and so is freshly brewed coffee, made from ""barako"" coffee beans (a strong coffee made from Liberica coffee beans), just to whet the appetite. Since our group of 12 people were all tired and hungry, we managed to finish the bowls of ""bulalo"", ""crispy tawilis"", and tons of hot steaming rice in no time, with native vinegar, ""Siling Labuyo"" (small chili peppers native to the Philippines), and ""Calamansi"" (Philippine lime) on the side. After that ""feel happy"" lunch, we went down to the ground floor of Mahogany Market to buy some goodies like dried fish of various varieties (including dried ""tawilis""), salted eggs, watermelon, and native sweets like the native ""bandi"" (disc-shaped sweetened peanuts), to be eaten or to be brought home as ""pasalubong"" (take-home gifts). Fresh beef can be bought at Mahogany Market at relatively lower prices. The beef sold here are so fresh that they really look and smell fresh, no doubt about it. You can see beef being delivered every half hour and buyers, including tourists, flock to the stalls to buy freshly-butchered beef. ""Bulalo""... food items... fresh beef... That's not all that Mahogany Market has to offer. The street on the back or the northern side of Mahogany Market is lined with vendors selling plants, particularly fruit seedlings which are a goldmine for tourists who are fond of growing trees and plants for their home gardens. I had some interesting finds: jackfruit, grapes, mangoes, lychees, rambutan, longan, oranges, etc. I told one of the vendors to reserve some dwarf lychee seedlings for me when I come back.  The visit to Mahogany Market took around 2 hours but it was worth the time. Despite the long travel time from Manila ,I would definitely come back next time to Tagaytay, but this time with my family and yes... visit Mahogany Market.

First off, the massage rooms look unhygenic. The mattresses are oily and the towels are oily too. The massage bed was terrible. It’s set up on the floor and I ended up getting a stiff neck and sore arms instead of feeling relaxed. To top it off, my masseuse kept burping for some reason. She didn’t even make an effort to cover her mouth or turn away when she did. Overall, the massage was not worth it.",Apr 2019,Solo,",7 June 2019"

Thats why I was excited to find that there was a Nuat Thai branch in Serin when I went to Tagaytay. My bf and I had a few options but I told him we try this massage service.,Jul 2018,Couples,",10 July 2018"

The experience was great!! Flor was very patient, friendly, funny and helpful (especially when we were buying souvenirs). He is a great driver and answered all our questions. The best part was going to the Pagsanjan Falls where we took a canoe boat ride to the falls. I thought we would do the paddling but it was actually two boatmen who did all the paddling (thank goodness!). Be sure to bring a change of clothes as you will get drenched but it's fun!

I was only in country for 11 days for work so did this on the one Saturday that I had. Floridel was our tour guide and he was excellent, highly recommend him. He is knowledgeable of the area and generally just a good bloke to have a chat with. I do wish the web site had let us know that there are actually three tips to consider, two boatmen that take you to the falls but then there is a raft that takes you the last little bit and you can also tip the raftsman. While the tips are not mandatory I intended to give them but only brought enough for two men. That’s a tiny gripe though, overall this was amazing and definitely worth the money!",Jun 2023,Couples,",26 June 2023"
