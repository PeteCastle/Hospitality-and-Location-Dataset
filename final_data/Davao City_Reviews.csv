No matter the amenities, technology, comfort, or even food, a restaurant cannot reach the pinnacle of its success without its most important resource: People. I must make...a special mention of Jubb. This young man is an outstanding host, and an even better human being. He is a credit to your image and reputation, and a key to your future success. I could not be more satisfied and grateful for his kindness, attentiveness, professionalism, and authenticity. Jubb treated me with white-glove service at every opportunity. I never felt neglected or ignored. Every business needs someone like him, and your restaurant is distinctly fortunate to have him. He deserves great recognition for impressive service.",Date of visit:,/ShowUserReviews-g298459-d17329235-r912927410-Madayaw_Cafe-Davao_City_Davao_del_Sur_Province_Mindanao.html,restaurant,,,,,

80,Bondi&Bourke Davao,Davao City,5.0,"February 1, 2021","So good, i went back twice in 24 hours","I heard lots of good things and Bondi but never quite had the time to visit previously. With COVID restrictions in place, I have made an effort to adhere to the regulations and at the same time support local restaurants when practical... the visit to...Bondi was one such venue.

As always to find out the heart of a good restaurant, you order off menu and at a time that is not easy... so as to get  feel for all aspects of the business.

It as 11.30 a.m on a Thursday and the restaurant was busy therefore it was time to sample their best steak, having heard from many friends how good it was at Bondi.

I was impressed with the menu however asked them if its possible to meet either the chef or owner as I had question. My question was simple,  what is the best steak you can offer. I was greeted by a super friendly Australian man named Pat, who introduced himself as both the chef and owner. I told Pat that I would like his best steak to which he offered me a cut from his personal stock, a gesture i was not expecting but truly grateful.

Before long I was slicing into what is best described as an excellent cut of meat cooked perfectly and also rested to perfection. Pat and his team know the importance of timing when cooking steak, including resting.

I enjoyed the steak so much, I came back with friends for brunch the following day. Again, great food, cooked perfectly and with simple prompt service by the wait staff.

In summary, by far the best restaurant in Davao and despite COVID, Bondi know how to cook a good meal",Date of visit:,/ShowUserReviews-g298459-d11916724-r782121662-Bondi_Bourke_Davao-Davao_City_Davao_del_Sur_Province_Mindanao.html,restaurant,,,,,

That said,  chef Patric and his team are dedicated to altering that.  For the moment though let's just say that if you...find yourself here for a few days Bondi&Bourke is a must visit. 

I'm here for 5 facts and I've found myself visiting B&B 3 times. I'll admit the first time was an easy choice add I'd just arrived in Davao and it's attached to the Bourke hotel where I'm staying. 

But let's get to the food.   The menu is smallish and easy to navigate.   The food fresh tasting, nicely presented, and while not memorable like eating at Per Se, but for the price one is not left wanting.  If you're here for a few days, you too might find yourself a repeat customer. 

Service was impeccable, the setting - an old home set in the middle of a small retail center - a pleasant repast. 

All in all, I'd have given Bondi & Bourke a 4.5 star rating most likely but the extra effort of owner/chef Patric tipped the scale.",Date of visit:,/ShowUserReviews-g298459-d11916724-r745000622-Bondi_Bourke_Davao-Davao_City_Davao_del_Sur_Province_Mindanao.html,restaurant,,,,,

The entrees were also good. I found the serving to be generous and the wait, reasonable. BUT that was because we went before it was lunch. We were already seated by around 11:00. By the time lunch came, the restaurant was full as it were a week day.

I opted for the Unforgettable Grilled Pork Ribs, which came clothed in a finger-licking good barbecue sauce. The meat was tender, but not fall-off-the-bone tender. The ribs were tasty and well-marinated that you won't find the need for more sauce; but what made them unforgettable for me was its value-for-money rather than the taste. 

The highlight of the meal was definitely its Sans Rival, which effortlessly beats out all the other sans rivals I’ve tasted. To be honest, its Sans Rival didn’t come with any frills or surprises. It simply consisted of layers of cashews, meringue, and butter filling; but the end result was simply perfection. This was amazing, and I would definitely fly to Davao City just for this.

Tempting as it was to try out its other dishes, my stomach was set on being fed the Grilled Panga. Boy, did it deliver! The gorgeous tuna jaw boasted of tender meat oozing with its own juices. It also came with pleasantly charred edges that lend it a smoky flavor. Pair this up with some spiced toyomansi and rice, and it’s pure heaven. I honestly can eat this every single day!

Since we’ve been pampered with surprisingly excellent squid dishes throughout our short stay in Davao, I figured that it’s best to have one more round of squid for our last meal.

154,Ahfat Seafood Plaza,Davao City,1.0,"November 6, 2019",Bait and switch on live seafood if your are a tourist,"Sad we went to the original of the three in the same plaza and got cheated by this unethical operator.  I am a Cantonese chef so to judge how well the steam fish is by order a live fish here.  I ordered a live laupu-laupu...displayed in the fish tank.  The marked up between a live fish and one that is frozen is 1,800 pesos.   The steamed fish arrived from the kitchen was drenched in heavy soy sauce.  This is a bad sign as a way to mask the taste of a unfresh fish common practice in unethical Chinese seafood restaurants.  I knew it as I took the first bit; the flesh was rubbery boardering hard like biting into a balut.  This fish has been previously preserved with baking soda.  Closer exam confirmed this was a dead fish from frozen due to sunken eyes and no traces of blood on spine after gills being removed previously before it went to freezer. 

I had to call the tourist police from nearby Victoria Mall on AhFat because no one here was nonresponsive to my request for a price adjustment from cashiers to waiter saying this place has no manager/owners.  The 30 something YO owner/manager arrived.  This young man obviously never set foot working in the kitchen challenged me, and told the police that they have video from CCTV cam in the kitchen showing the live fish I picked went right into the steamer.  But the proof never arrived.  Until the tourist police threatening to arrest them, the young man authorized price adjustment to frozen fish price.  It should not have to come to this point after making scene with a tourist police in your restaurant as manager.  This place still trying to cheat you with frozen fish pricing until I showed them the correct price stipulated on the menu.  The tourist police asked them why they did not update menu if price on frozen fish has increased.  Ahfat had no anwers so the refunded the differences again.

They have many types of sausage, cheese, German beer, pickles, and other items that you won’t find elsewhere in Davao City.  My only regret is not checking this place out years ago.  The restaurant is behind the deli.  Although I wasn’t hungry for lunch at the time, I nevertheless asked to see the menu, and I was impressed.

Although the ambiance is nice, the service and food was poor. We came here for lunch and there was only 1 other table being served. After we ordered our food, it...took a long time to get our food even if there was only 1 other table there (the restaurant was not fully occupied). However, the other table were getting served quickly. The food we ate didn't taste all that great especially for the price. After we finished, we asked for our desert. But nobody ever gave us the desert. So I asked again for the desert and they totally forgot about it. I then decided to cancel our desert. I paid and left the restaurant. We were disappointed not only because the food was not good but because it took a very long time to receive our food and we were totally forgotten even if there was only 1 other table besides us. I can understand if the place was busy but it was not. The people at the other table were treated like VIP royalty while we were treated like a disease.

Don't expect much from the salad bar but the offerings are adequate. Food is okay but didn't impress much on flavor. We didn't order the house specialty so they probably...don't really give their other menu much thought. 

The service is slow. It took more than 30 mins for a meal of grilled prawns and a sandwich. Considering the place was not full at the time we visited we had to call the servers attention several times to refill our glasses. They should be giving their customers the same attention and not just to a particular table.

247,Penong's Barbeque Seafoods and Grill,Davao City,4.0,"October 15, 2019",Extreme Value for Money,"Penong’s was a popular recommendation from the Let’s Eat Pare Facebook group, so I figured that it was worth a visit. Penong's is your typical ‘ihawan’ or grilled meats restaurant; which meant that it was not airconditioned. 

Similar to its counterparts in Manila, the restaurant...offers unlimited rice and unlimited soup; which guarantees a filling meal for any hungry stomach. One amusing thing about it though is that the restaurant encourages you to call the waiters’ attention by clapping your hands; instead of simply raising them. 

We ordered the Pork BBQ, which came with three small sticks; each boasting of glistening juicy and well-marinated pork. Douse them in vinegar and you’re good to go. These were good, but nowhere close to the barbecue sticks I’ve had in Puerto Princesa. Surprisingly, it was the Sizzling Squid which grabbed our attention. Served on a sizzling plate, the squid was perfectly tender. The gravy left a lot to be desired though, so it's best to swap it with the ever trusty toyomansi dip so as not to waste such a perfectly cooked squid.",Date of visit:,/ShowUserReviews-g298459-d2017324-r718560135-Penong_s_Barbeque_Seafoods_and_Grill-Davao_City_Davao_del_Sur_Province_Mindanao.html,restaurant,,,,,

250,Penong's Barbeque Seafoods and Grill,Davao City,4.0,"July 8, 2019",Branches all over Davao,"There seems to be a branch of Penong's restaurants across from or in almost every mall in Davao.  Its become a favorite in a short time.  Tasty BBQ for a low price, and yummy milkshakes.  Have eaten now at the one across from Victoria Plaza...Mall, across from Gaisano Mall, and inside Abreeza Mall (on the third floor).  Everything I ate was yummy at the first two locations, but the experience at Abreeza Mall was mixed.  

The first two times I ate at Abreeza Mall was good.  The third (today for lunch) was a disaster.  I order two pieces of chicken and pork chop.  The restaurant was not busy, but it took longer than usual to get the food. I only got one piece of chicken and it looked like someone had pulled all the meat off of it.  It had shockingly little meat.  I could see the entire bone of the drumstick. They brought a liempo instead of the pork chop I ordered, and it was quite cold and chewy/fatty.  No one seemed interested in correcting my order, and they insisted that I was pointing at liempo while I clearly said pork chop.  Most waiters confirm your order but this one did not, and I think he had zero interest in making my order good.  Nor did the girl at the cash register that I called her over to try to figure out if I had someone else's order since mine was so deficient.  I left hungry and feeling ripped off, and immediately went to get a JM Swarma a few feet away (it was yummy and filled me up). I recommend avoiding the Abreeza Mall location until they get a manager on duty there that will interact with customers, and a wait staff interested in keeping customers happy.  I would rate each location 5 star except Abreeza which was five stars the first few visits and negative stars today.",Date of visit:,/ShowUserReviews-g298459-d2017324-r687790966-Penong_s_Barbeque_Seafoods_and_Grill-Davao_City_Davao_del_Sur_Province_Mindanao.html,restaurant,,,,,

We had brunch here so we were probably the first customers for the day being there at...10am very hungry since we didn't have dinner the night before. 

The side door signage read that it was closed and being Halloween, we thought it was. But the front door looked open and upon entering, the lady said they were open.

It took a while for our orders to arrive about 20 mins since they were just prepping the dimsum for the day.

Enjoyed the spare ribs, chicken wings, Japanese siomai and of course the highlight was the pork Xiao Long Bao. There was another variety but this was the one we tried and it did not disappoint.

It's tasted almost like Din Tai Fung if you close your eyes, in this small little eatery that had a few tables in it but we can imagine it can easily get packed on lunch or dinner hours.

Out came the Dim Sum Platter, bringing more genuine taste and the Dragon Balls with a salsa of sili and red onions capped our regular courses.

The only objection I have is the coco oil used to fry in. It adds a flavor to fried foods that I do not like. The Dragon Balls themselves were quite spicy and tasty.

Macha Green Tea Buchi followed for dessert. These had a strange texture to them. Gummy and a bit grainy but the flavor was good.

I like it here sinces...it is not as crowded as the known buffet here in the city. Service is also great! Parking is not a problem. There are a lot of salads that you can choose from. You can also create your own salad, etc.. but if you are hesitant since you are not sure on how to DIY salad... There are salads served that you can choose from.

It is a bit pricey though, but it is like you own the place since there are less people... Oh, forgot to mention that their roast beef is really tender and tastes good... Unlike the competitor's roast beef which seems to have some kind of an armor... LOLs

It has a good selection of appetizers with cold cuts I enjoy like Jamon Serrano, real dry salami, smoked salmon, among others. I like that they carry Malagos cheese in their cheese section. They cater to Chinese clients too so there is the congee with all the condiments, steamed siomai and siopao, and for Japanese clients, the different sushis. Filipinos can get their fill of Lomi. The fruits and nuts are varied both natively grown in Davao or imported from Manila or abroad. The salad bar is scrumptious, the breads, croissants, and pastries plentiful and the cereals are varied. After just these, I usually do not have room for the main course of various breakfast meats and sausages,garlic fried or steamed or chinese fried rice, go very well with these. And if you have room, they do have cakes and pastries for dessert!

*QUIRINO branch*
Time of visit: 5pm
I ordered their chicken wing but told me that their chicken was very frozen. I asked for nachos they said...they were not available. I tried ordering their milkshake, again not available. So I ordered a burger instead. I asked for their disposable gloves. They were out of stock and that they were still buying the gloves. I asked for a knife and fork but the staff told me that they don't use those things because they're using gloves(out of stock). So I opted to use my bare hands. I decided to wash my hands on their faucet but the plumbing's is not working so they told me to wash my hands on their C.R....
*ECOLAND branch*
Time of visit: 6:30pm
The place was not very well-ventilated. You can almost feel yourself suffocating despite their electric fan. I asked for their male staff if they could lower the temp on their aircon since it's very hot, but he refused because they maintained their thermostat that way. We ordered a burger (non pork), nachos and cheese, and regular fries and iced tea. I again asked for milkshake, but not available again. We were waiting for almost 30mins for our order. I can understand if their were many customers but we were the only one there but after 15mins, a couple came in. 10mins after the burgers came in. I asked for a disposable gloves and again the staff told me they don't have one and ""pagkuha lng sa Grillery maam"". I let that one slide. I was half way through eating my burger I approached the female staff for our iced tea (since they didn't serve us service water and we were really thirsty) and she told me ""paghulat lng sa ma'am"" with an annoyed tone of voice. It was not until 8mins that our iced tea finally came in. The nachos and fries came in after another 10mins. I'm almost through eating my burger when I noticed a slice of bacon on my burger. I clarified with the male staff if it contains pork and he said yes. I asked him before ordering if the burger has no pork and still, he said yes. So I naturally flipped since I don't eat pork. He asked the female staff if it's pork and the female staff said it's yakiniku beef but I already lost my appetite.

I usually recommend BB to my friends since it's my hang out place when I was still in college. But now I would not recommend the place even if the food's nice.",Date of visit:,/ShowUserReviews-g298459-d6646501-r542970581-Backyard_Burgers_Central-Davao_City_Davao_del_Sur_Province_Mindanao.html,restaurant,,,,,
361,Backyard Burgers Central,Davao City,4.0,"September 7, 2017",Loaded with lots of fun,"At first, I was apprehensive about entering this restaurant because from past experience, my shirt would take on the smell of grease from the grill and regret it the rest of the day. No such thing happened. The grill was separated by a glass barrier...in a well ventilated kitchen so no smoke comes into the dining area. These people might have some experience in a bio-safety level 4 category laboratory.

So I settled in a nice quiet corner waiting for a dear friend who was meeting me for lunch. Had a San Miguel pale pilsen - which is always good in Davao City, then another one - until my lunch date arrived.

We ordered two fully loaded burgers which I might say was moderately priced - not cheap - but not pocket-busting expensive. Seeing what they put into the burger justifies the cost. 

It did not take much time for the burgers to be served as we were virtually the only customers during that weekday lunch date. Happily digging into our burgers we were informed that we were entitled to two more free-burgers which was part of their promotion for that period. Mind you - this might no longer be on offer - but I just had to share the surprises that might await you when you when you drop by Backyard Burger.

There are no less than two Backyard Burger restaurants in Davao city. This one was along Quimpo Blvd - on Ecoland and is not far from SM City.

The bottom bun was cold and was soaked in the dressing and oil from the pattie so it just took 2 bites until it started to fall apart. Nothing special about the mayo or ketchup or bacon. Although the lettuce was crispy.

The food choices are not that much but not that few too and for the price, it was worth it. As our host said, it wouldn't be a complete Davao experience without eating here.

The problem was the egg station. We started the breakfast...early around 630am, since it will be a busy day. I went to the egg station to order 2 sunnyside up egg. Then the ala-chef uniformed lady named Bianca said, just get this eggs here. (Pointing at the pre-cooked egg). I told her, I preferred freshly cook one. Her facial reaction looks like she got annoyed, body reaction was really negative. I looked at her and told her that, I want freshly cooked egg 
All the time we were seating at our table we noticed that she will talk to other waiter, almost pointing at us and then she will make faces. We didn't want to ruin our day so we ignored her. 
With out three day stay at the hotel, we refused to go to the egg station because she was there. It may seem petty but we stand to our high standard of customer service. Clearly, it was a bad experience with her. 
I'd like to ask the F&B management to retrain her and make sure that she follows the order of your guests.

430,Misto,Davao City,3.0,"June 19, 2018",Decent,"As buffet breakfast fans, we had high hopes after reading Misto's glowing reviews. Sadly, it fell short of our expectations. Did we expect much? Yes, considering that Seda is one of the most premier and expensive hotels in Davao. But what they had on offer...was pretty much standard fare, nothing special. 

We were hoping for typical Filipino breakfast items like corned beef, tocino, tapa, longganisa... None of those were present. Had cereal options but no milk... Well they did have milk but took a while for them to refill. Same with the scrambled eggs. Refilling time was slow. Ordinary sausages that were tough. Ice container left empty with melted ice (by then was just water). No danishes or croissants. Rice was clumpy. However, pancake and egg station was excellent!

Customer service pleasant and professional. 

Overall, just a decent breakfast spread that you can get from any other hotel that's cheaper. Maybe we just got unlucky and visited at the wrong time. We're thankful though that they did accommodate walk-ins like us. Hope to drop by in the future to an improved menu and table layout.

Breakfast served was buffet type . Wide...selection from local to Western cuisine . I liked the meals I had , it was quite filling . Loved the fruits and local desserts .  Missed the croissants and although I was looking for peanut butter they offered to get one from the kitchen , to which I politely obliged . Worth noting is the lady chef who whipped nice omelettes at the egg station. And when I asked for a single egg for my over easy , she does what I instructed . Cant help observing however the refill time was either slow or they change it with a less appealing cuisine by around 9 am. I had breakfast twice by the way.  You also have your choice of coffee ( latte , capuccino etc ) and tea variant . Other lesser known establishment charge tea in their package . 
Night cap was worth the leisurely stay . With acoustic performance from 8-10 pm , I enjoyed my Malagos dark chocolate cheese cake .

I ordered the burrata and shrimp salad. I got a massive pile of...lettuce, enough to feed a family for a week. No person needs that much lettuce! The burrata was solid but we are in Davao, not Italy, so not a big deal. Add 4 chewy fried prawns, olives, a hand full of tomatoes and a mustard dressing…….nothing went well together, and even if it did the lettuce mountain would have drowned if! 950 pesos 😳
The ribs were ok but we’ve had better at a tenth of the price…. The ribs and potato were microwaved and served. White wine was poured into this awful decanter where it was left to go warm. No ice bucket.
No staff asked if our food was ok, nobody cared. Poor food, poor service and a total waste of money.

Also, there were no floor towels for the shower or hand towels for the bathroom.  The shower takes about 15 minutes for the water to get even remotely warm.

It's right at the heart of Davao city, only a few meters away from Roxas Ave which offers food bazaar nightly. Roxas Ave is also like a main hub for all commuter jeepneys as most of the routes cross this area.   We booked a de luxe room which was good for two for P950 per night with free bfast for one. It has a small flat screen TV, a dresser and a cabinet. The bed is comfy but if you are a tall person (probably 5'10 and above), get a much bigger room as this room is very small and you probably need to crouch on the bed so you wont have to put your feet against the wall (that's how small the room is).

23,Davao Crocodile Park,Davao City,3.0,,In Need Of Investigation,"After many years, I revisited this place with my extended family and children. I must say it has really been neglected and the cages are pitiful for a few of the animals. As a member of OFI and AOP, the poor Orangutan was in a disgusting cage and should be rehabilitated. I spent a long time studying this wonderful primate with Dr Galdikas and I sponsor three in Borneo.  I will follow this up with the foundation.   The Lion and Lioness are another exhibit which is small and disgusting. This is the King of the jungle which needs space and so sad to see this in this day and age.   The Tiger had a little area to run which was better than its counterparts. Hands on feeding of Koi fish, Rabbits, Ostrich was good and the play area was lovely for the children.

222,Gaisano Mall of Davao,Davao City,3.0,,It was kinda a good one,"Based on my observation, I suggest that large supermarkets should assign enough staff or salespeople to help the customers find the product they’re finding immediately. Because I observe that most staff in large supermarkets are super busy to even assist other customers. Furthermore, I think it is really crucial that customers should have someone to assist them considering that the workers are more equipped with knowledge about the products they are selling thus they can make suggestions to the customers in terms of what products are very high in demand, what products many people buy, and even what products received most positive feedbacks. In addition, large supermarkets or even just small stores should never forget to remind their staff to be as friendly as they can and to appear welcoming to their customers because we all know that people also include great shopping experience in their buying behavior. So stores or supermarkets should remind staff to smile widely on their customers. Furthermore, I think it is also a good idea to gather suggestions from the customers themselves since they will be the one to buy the products in the first place, that means their perspectives, insights, and suggestions will play a big part in your company’s sale. Also stores or supermarkets should be held accountable and responsible for whatever outcome may happen in their customers, they should not run away from their mistakes. Lastly, it is not a bad idea to hold an annual celebration for their customers and staff just for example offering rewards for customer’s loyalty or rewarding their staff as best employee of the month. Therefore, all those I wrote above are my suggestions to make not only my personal shopping experience great but as well other people’s shopping experience.",Jan 2022,/ShowUserReviews-g298459-d3692623-r829075731-Gaisano_Mall_of_Davao-Davao_City_Davao_del_Sur_Province_Mindanao.html,tourist_sites,,/Profile/glendelannec,Glendel Anne C,,",23 February 2022"
