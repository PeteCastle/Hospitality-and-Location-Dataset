Medley Buffet,5.0,"August 13, 2023",Beyond expectation,"I will not let this day pass. We spent our dinner yesterday celebrating the occasion of my loved one at Medley Buffet at Okada and they showed us unbelievable service. Why? Because the food was outstanding and the staff were very friendly and accommodating.

We...visited a lot of buffet restaurants in a several city's but this one is very calming and relaxing, not to mention the perfect view of the sunset.

I must say that everything was excellent. I wasn't expecting that this occasion would be perfect as planned.

How should I ever forget this? We were surprised when the chef delivered us a plate of  Japanese Shashimi. We have Singaporean and buttered-style lobsters served on our table. He even offered us if we liked a baked lobster. The result is amazing as we tasted one of a Michelin star cuisines. Kudos chefs! 

Our sincerest thanks for the surprise song with the matching cake ‚ù§Ô∏è it means a lot to us since we are away from our family to celebrate this special day.

And lastly, I would like to express my gratitude especially to Ms. Jecka and Mr. Paul for providing me and my partner with a tremendous experience that we will never forget!  Not everyone is hands-on like you. You are both truly a gem that should be treasured. Your smiles never disappear from your faces every time you assist us.

I would definitely recommend this restaurant to my family and friends! We will surely visit again your resto. Cheers!",Date of visit:,/ShowUserReviews-g312693-d12402262-r909894124-Medley_Buffet-Paranaque_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html

The Peak,3.0,"August 12, 2023",The Peak at Grand Hyatt Manila,"I made a reservation to celebrate my graduation celebration and the birthday of my sister-in-law. They said that they have two time slots: 5PM and 8:30PM. I chose the 8:30PM time slot. We arrived early at 8PM and they led us to the bar to...wait as they are still preparing which is okay for us since our reservation is still at 8:30PM. We were then seated at the restaurant at around 8:40PM. When it‚Äôs our time to order, we chose the Signature Menu. The server informed us that the Signature Menu is not available anymore since they only serve it until 8:30PM. We kindly asked the server if she can ask the chef/kitchen staff since it‚Äôs kinda unfair since their only time slots were 5:00PM and 8:30PM. Thankfully, they accommodated our Signature Menu orders.

As mentioned, we were celebrating two occasions but it did not feel as special celebrating it in The Peak.

Nevertheless, it offers great view and good food.

Antonio's Garden,5.0,"November 11, 2022",One of the best dining experiences of my life !!!!,"The plan was to go and have a steak main course and nothing else as we had done nothing but eat far too much during the previous week.

Our plans soon went array! As soon as you arrive, you get that feeling that this is...indeed a very special place and that perhaps you should indulge to get the full benefit.

The original one course idea turned into six courses.......all of which were cooked to perfection and sublime in every way.

Veal bone marrow with pecorino to start was rich, packed with favour and truly unctuous.

A small salad of strawberries, radish, walnut and blue cheese followed, this unassuming salad was packed with surprises, every mouthful, another taste explosion. As salads go this was a masterclass.

The lightest clam chowder followed. Intense and fishy without that usual chowder heaviness.

Next a pineapple palate cleanser- I admit I am not actually a fan of sorbet/granita as a palate cleanser, but this was packed to the rafters with intense pineapple flavours.

Dry aged rib eye followed; it was exquisite. The multiply accompaniments were a classy touch - Hollandaise, burnt onion sauce, chilli flakes and pickled garlic all added another dimension to every slice of that very happy cow (sadly/or happily departed depending on your viewpoint).

After five courses there really is not much point in avoiding dessert. Chocolate and olive cake with honeycomb and ice cream and the Italian version of 'floating islands' were just to die for.

The last time I ate this well was at Gordon Ramsey, Hospital Road over ten years ago. I've been trying to decide which was better and, in my opinion, they are now both in my top 1.

In summary, an exceptional dining experience and one which I will remember for many years, the food was so well executed and perfect that I felt emotional.

Antonio's Garden,5.0,"November 3, 2021",A perfect culinary experience!,"Our first, but certainly not last, visit to this superb restaurant on the occasion of our daughter's 30th birthday. Despite not having made a reservation we were warmly welcomed and shown to a very nice, round, table. All members of staff were friendly, discreet, and...highly professional. The Ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel, Anthony, took excellent care of us and was a very pleasant person to meet - and meet again.

As appetizer, our daughter chose the Baked Burrata in Phyllo while my wife and I enjoyed the excellent, and very generous, P√¢t√© de Foie Gras. For the main course my wife chose the Akaroa Salmon Wellington, while my daughter and I enjoyed sharing the Angus Rib Eye Steak. The quality, taste and presentation of all dishes was truly excellent - the best we have ever experienced in the Philippines, and well on par with the best Europe can offer.

All main courses are in themselves generously sized, and additionally come with a salad, a soup, a delicious mini-scoop of cucumber and mint sorbet, a dessert and coffee - so you certainly will not leave hungry! To celebrate the special day we enjoyed sharing a bottle of Italian Prosecco which went very well with our meal choices.

We have been to our fair share of Michelin-starred restaurants in Europe, and Antonio's Garden is really at the same level, if not better in some respects. It's not inexpensive, but very much value for money.

I was curious, being an Ilonggo, as to how a place with an Ilonggo name came to be in Tagaytay where...Tagalog is spoken. When we arrived at Balay Dako, we were very impressed by the size of the place. Balay Dako means large (dako) house (balay) in Ilonggo. The setting was just beautiful and the grounds and building were very well kept. It was meant to be reminiscent of a large family house from decades past. Luckily, we were there on a Tuesday afternoon and we were able to avoid the usual weekend crowds. I would estimate that it only took us about 20 to 25 minutes to get seated at a table by the window with a great view of Taal. The menu can be deceiving since we order kare kare and kansi amongst other dishes. The size of the bowl was very large and was full. I travelled all the way from Iloilo just to try one of the best kansi that I have ever tried. The servers were very attentive to our every need. The service at Balay Dako was great.

The dining room was quite large and the window outside looks out to the water and the Taal volcano. We grabbed a few items to share. Most of the items were quite tasty. I quite like the lechon kawali with the tender meat and crispy skin. The sisig was also nice as was the squid rings. The kansi with the banana flower was interesting but not to my liking.

Balay Dako,2.0,"April 22, 2023",My last visit,"Just had lunch there, my 2nd visit, and I have to say will be my last. Since nothing changed from our last visit.

The place is overpriced for the quality of the food & overall taste. We could've eaten in other places at a fraction...of the price we paid and still got a better food quality.

1. Eventhough it is the summer and the temp reaches to about 34 degrees, I still expect the Bulalo to be served steaming hot. Ours was warm to almost room temp.

2. Server took the time to refill the water on our table. It's not even lunch service where everything is chaotic.

3. Parking attendants let cars in when there are no parking spaces, hence, those that need to leave, can't because the cars are blocking the way.

4. Although they have a ramp going into the dining area, I still consider the place not wheelchair friendly as the dining tables are placed close to each other making it difficult to manuever the wheelchair. You may need to ask other guest to stand up or make room for you.

The good side, though:

1. The food was served maybe 10 or 15 mins after we placed our order.

2. The server was more attentive after I complained.

Of all the restaurants by Antonio's group of restaurants, this is my least favorite.

Sonya's Secret Garden,5.0,"September 2, 2022",Outstanding experience,"If serenity and connecting with nature is what you are looking for then this place is it. The staff welcomed us with a delicious dalandan fruit juice.  We stayed overnight at the Lavender cottage with the family of 8.  This cottage can accommodate 13 comfortably....The rooms are spectacular and everything is clean and well maintained. Really nice to just chat and catch up with the family in the spacious living room with the birds chirping in the background.
We spent the morning walking around the place. A must if you stay here.  The gardens are well manicured.  
The courtesy and hospitality of the staff is second to none.  They greet you and are very welcoming.  Special shout out to Jiowell(?) for taking time to tell us more about the owner and the uniqueness of the place.
Food is abundant and all were tasty.  You will get full.  Guaranteed!  The staff offered us tarragon with berry tea.  Never had this before.  The aroma is sweet and smooth to sip.  I had seconds!
They gave us a 'secret' gift upon check out.  Very nice touch.

Sonya's Secret Garden,2.0,"August 21, 2022",The Worst Buffet in Town,"Tagaytay has hundreds of places to eat but this has to be one of the worst. Ate with my family for Sunday lunch. Was expecting some kind of oasis full of plants flowers and trees. Was expecting good food but what we got was the...worst lunch buffet we have ever tried. The buffet had two types of spaghetti and chicken breast. Thats it. The waiters make sure to serve you the food on your table rather than you get it at the buffet table in an attempt to cut back on the portions. We were a table of 5 but they only put down two small plates of chicken breasts for our lunch. They say its eat all you can but they are definitely trying to regulate how much you eat. 

We wanted to order from the menu because we didnt like the buffet offering but the waiters said that we had to eat the buffet. 

Dont waste your time on this place. I think the public knows this is a place to avoid because there were very few people dining there. I guess we were the only out of town suckers that day.

Breakfast at Antonio's,3.0,"August 25, 2023",Antonio's Bfast Experience..,"Come early if you want to get seated immediately.
Plan your orders before arriving so you can give them to the staff after getting seated. Serving may take a while if the place is already full.
The basket of bread was good, but a little...expensive (350) because it was just maybe 2 pandesal, 2 loaves of bread, some stick bread, and some jam&butter.
If you order sausages with your pancakes, make sure to check if it's cooked well once your it's served because ours was not. 
If the weather's not that cold or too hot, don't agree to get seated on their garden area. There's lots of mosquitos too in the garden. Their garden area could be improved to get your money's worth because you're paying for meals that are extra pricey (e.g. extra sunny side up is more than 100 if I recall it right.
When you order coffee, make sure to inform the server you want it served hot, not luke warm. My capuccino was just warm, almost same with the weather that day. Again, maybe because the serving takes a while that's why food arrives not too hot/warm.
My kid didn't like the breaded chicken that we ordered with his waffle. But he really liked the pandesal (if it was a pandesal) in the basket of bread.",Date of visit:,/ShowUserReviews-g317121-d4093172-r912716290-Breakfast_at_Antonio_s-Tagaytay_Cavite_Province_Calabarzon_Region_Luzon.html

Marcia Adams Restaurant,3.0,"November 25, 2022",Creepy place at night,"We tried this place as it was highly recommended by my sister as she went to visit this place only a few weeks before we actually tried it. We visited this place for dinner and apparently, it was kinda rainy and cold so this gave...us all a chill while walking down the steep aisle going to the restaurant. The place was a bit dark surrounded by small lights here and there and it was surrounded by lush greeneries and other vegetation. We were escorted to our table and room looks like a very old house that has been slightly refurbished to maintain its old look. But personally didnt like the feel as it was kinda creepy that night.

As for the food, it was a set meal intended to be consumed whether you dont feel like eating an appetizer or a dessert for that matter. I ordered the big fat slab of grilled pork chop which was too much for me to finish.

The food is very good here and was kind of surprised of the Tuscan pork chop I got with my meal. The food is very good with the lettuce chips served with tzatziki yogurt dip, then I had mango kiwi pavlova. Then we shared a guyabano fizz - yummy in my tummy!
I liked the trinkets and the ambiance is magical. It was on a blue sunset in Tagaytay. Everything created a magical night and enjoyed every moment of it.

The menu involves selecting three courses for the price of the main meal. What a brilliant idea to encourage us to eat properly! The dishes were a feast for the eyes as well as the palate. Yes, a minimum price approx ¬£11 for a three course meal - that is very reasonable - and it is quality rather than quantity. An option at this price: tzatsiki with lettuce crisps, chicken kebabs, pannacotta. Lots of options on the menu that I would try in the future when I return (in daylight).

It is very special because all the dishes are unique yet the deliciousness are all heartwarming ly familiar. 

We ordered the following:

Appetizer: Butter Shrimps
=Nicely done üëå Shrimps are indeed buttery soft, garlicky but subtle. Ain instant favorite. A must-try!

Beef: Bulalo
=One of the best I've tasted! Not a single bit of that oily or ma-sebo soup. They patiently remove the oily stuff so all you get is the tenderest beef and most flavorful broth. With fresh veggies too! Yum! Theirs is the only Bulalo we will eat from now on.

Pork: Grilled Liempo
=Another hit!  Soft and just the right balance of flavors/seasoning. And the ""ihaw"" taste is right. You know they grilled it using good firewood, (not with kerosene or plastic!). 

Fish: Crispy Daing na Bangus
=Fresh, well seasoned, crispy and no ""gilik"" taste. Just the way you want your bangus to be. 

Veggies: Fresh Lumpia Gulay
=Joy!!! Just JOY! The generous vegetables inside this Lumpia with it's peanuty sauce will make you smile! One order is not enough!

Dessert: Halo-Halo
=There's a special twist that i would like to share but you better discover this by yourself. The Ube Ice Cream is good, but the ""twist"" elevates it to an ""Aha! That works fabulously!"" experience.

Beverages: Hot Tarragon Herb Tea & Brewed Iced Tea with Calamansi
=Nothing artificial here. They are all natural, all fresh.

Truly a gem in Tagaytay! 

Do contact them and discover the flavors for yourselves! And a wonderful chat with Tita Medy makes everything heartwarming. I'm so happy to have met her and now call her a friend.

The place looked nice and the servers were very accommodating.

Negatives: Everything else

We ordered Uni Sashimi, Spicy Salmon Maki, California Maki, Miso Ramen, and their grilled us beef (forgot the exact name)

Uni sashimi tasted bland and old. The vegetables...that came with it wasn't fresh as well. Both Makis were just meh. Could compare it to something bought in the frozen section of an SM grocery. Ramen wasn't hot, tasted like instant ramen, and not the good kind. Grilled beef was basically beef tapa. Wasn't hot at all; as the name would suggest it would have been grilled. Felt like I ate something that was cooked earlier and microwaved for my pleasure üôÑ

It's been part of our milestones -- family trips, birthdays, reunions, date nights and even just random dinners. When we just want comfort food, we're here. We've seen it evolve over the decades and coming...here is like visiting an old friend for us. 

The food is always a hit - Chef Paul knows good steak. But his non-meat options are also just as good when you need variety. 

Much has been said about the service and we experience it too, as servers come and go. Our longtime favorite waiter retired and was recently replaced by new faces. There is a learning curve on the service but we are forgiving and don't let it deter us from the experience. We're here to enjoy a good meal not stress over the servers.

We always order:
- Blackened Beef Salad
- Tuna Salad
- Truffle Mushroom Pasta
- Ribeye
- Prawns with Angel Hair Pasta
- Pineapple Carpaccio

So YES. Obviously we recommend, despite the hundreds of new restaurants in Tagaytay, we've kept coming back. If a restaurant could be a home, this would be ours.

First of all, the striploin is good. I just wish that the server...should know how to listen, it seems like he make things complicated and he made us feel we don't know how to order a steak (lol) this is very basic as far as i know. What is exactly ON THE SIDE or what esle do you want to add for your side dish. So we had this kind of a conversation about the side orders, the server keep on saying that there is already ""INCLUSIVE"" side dish, but all we wanted was to add, and i literally went to the point i don't want to talk anymore, and gave a signal to my sister, i'm done with this conversation because i'm hungry, we travel from pampanga to tagaytay. 

To the server, i hope you will able to read this. You know who you are, please try to improve your PR, i actually don't like when they say ""FIRST IMPRESSIONS, LAST"" but definitely, NEVER AGAIN.

Fire Lake Grill,5.0,"April 12, 2022",A great view deserves great food.,"It has been a while since we visited Tagaytay. The pandemic really wrought havoc on our travel and date plans. Finally, on a weekend, we finally took the chance.

We found out about Fire Lake Grill thanks to Google. It was one of the top...search results. We were giddy to arrive.

The place was non-descript, nestled in the Cliffhouse Tagaytay. We almost drove past it. But the area was wide and we were able to park without much difficulty. Just a note: validate your parking ticket lest you want to pay gold for a few hours of parking.

We arrived and Kim, our server, welcomed us warmly and accosted us to our seats: right in front of us is a stunning view of Taal lake and volcano. Since we were famished, we started off with the Seared Tuna Salad Nicoise-style and Mushroom and Pumpkin Soups. The tuna was seated perfectly, with a nice blend of spices crusted around it. The Pumpkin soup was thick and creamy, bringing out the flavors even more.

The entr√©es were the stars of the show. A masterpiece of a TENDERloin, a juicy ribeye and a succulent lamb shank. Not to mention, a delectable saffron and herb risotto. The lamb and risotto was a perfect pair.

And to top it all off, the desserts. Tasty vanilla caramel cake and chocolate cakes flanking the signature Fire Lake dessert: pinapple carpaccio. Coconut ice cream in a pastry cup on a bed of paper-thin slices of pineapple. Eat it together and the flavors just burst in your mouth. I added the lime peel and it even gave a greater dimension to the taste.

Overall, it was a terrific experience at Fire Lake Grill. Great service. Great food. Great view.

The food was excellent! Mom & my kids loved the touch of spice used to jazz up the pumpkin soup, and my husband & I found the grilled tomato soup very refreshing.

The food is so-so, with only the crispy tawilis really showing promise. Crispy pata was a bit tough and rice too expensive for the quality. The soup and arroz caldo were also mediocre. We wanted to order their flatbread pizza but it was out of stock, so there goes the Italian. 

The facilities were average, definitely not cozy as some have described. It's more or less properly maintained, but the washroom has a smell.

The wicked Oreo is a must-try according to some reviews, but the 12 of us have to share the last 2 remaining servings.

Cafe Voi La,3.0,"September 5, 2021","Lovely place and good food, but bad service","We were supposed to go to another restaurant in the area, but we couldn't find it and we ended up in this restaurant. I really didn't mind discovering and trying out new places, especially one like Voi La, which has a beautiful ambiance and a...good selection of food. As we stepped into this restaurant I was immediately impressed with its decors, furniture, colorful lanterns, and so forth. Not bad at all, I said to myself. Then I skimmed over its menu. It had a good selection of Italian, Spanish, Thai and Filipino dishes. My expectations were really high, considering that they were quite expensive. It's fine, I said, since you pay not only for the food, but for the ambiance, too. Well, the foods didn't disappoint, except that I found the servings rather small. Everything would have been forgiveable, but then our dining experience was dampened by a couple of things. First, service was too slow. Second, the waiters were not as accommodating as  they should be. They were nowhere to be found near our table and I had to rise many times just to look for them and call their attention. I asked for an extra fork and I had to ask for it thrice before they brought me one. The same thing happened when I asked again for the menu. The waiter serving us also took forever to give us the bill when we asked for it. Hayz! In the end, out of our dissatisfaction for such a lousy service, we decided not to leave them any tip. It's a pity that a lovely place with good food would have such a terrible customer service. I don't think I'd be returning to this restaurant any time soon. Besides, they have a perennial problem with their parking lot. =(",Date of visit:,/ShowUserReviews-g317121-d8289810-r808313843-Cafe_Voi_La-Tagaytay_Cavite_Province_Calabarzon_Region_Luzon.html

Shambala Silang,1.0,"April 23, 2023","Worst Experience, Don‚Äôt waste your time. Go find somewhere else to go","Not worth visiting at all. You‚Äôre better off going someplace else. What a waste of beautiful space and environment. 

First - i asked them about the rates via Facebook Messenger and they said that the entrance fee is 200 and consumable with food. They did...not mention about the 500 minimum food requirement per person.

When we arrived, they started saying that the 200 per person entrance is only for the garden then we have to pay 300 for the food then we have to pay 200 for the gallery entrance fee. So in total we have to spend 700 pesos which we were not informed during our initial conversation in Facebook Messenger. The issue here is not the money, but the feeling that they did not tell us the prices early on during the fb messenger conversation. i felt that we were misinformed and coerced into going there by the premise that you can spend just 200 pesos. 

Second - They informed us that the food will take an hour to be served. This is okay since we did not pre-order and we can roam around while waiting for food. After 1.5 hours wala pa ring food. Even coke hindi pa din dumadating after 1.5 hours of ordering!. Hindi naman niluluto ang coke. Then the food arrived on by one and it was cold. We had to complain endlessly tapos saka lang sila nagmadali na i-release yung food.

Third - The Food also taste bland lalo na yung pasta dishes and pizza na parang frozen pizza lang. It was bad despite of it being pricey.

The crew apologized after our incessant complaints and gave us 1 complimentary ice cream cup per group. for me - the solution would have been to serve us the food on time as promised in one hour. that‚Äôs it. and please change your chef who cooks the western dishes. It was really bad.

You'll be surrounded by various bamboo varieties, flowering plants, bushes, ferns, overhanging vines, and tree species. Explore the second floor to learn about the owners' personal collection and become enthralled by the stories behind the various artworks. Shambala Silang was created and is curated by Riza Matibag Muyot. She is frequently in the garden grounds, to say hello and ask her about Shambala stories. The main Living Art Museum exhibits Cordilleran art, contemporary works by Filipino masters, and emerging works by young Filipino artists. The slopes on Shambala's hilly side are terraced, with foundations of rip-rapped tuffaceous stones made by true Cordilleran stone artisans.The authentic Dap-ay, where the tribal council meets with stone seats and a bonfire in the middle, is one of the Shambala Terraces' most impressive features.

Overall, we adore the art- and culture-inspired landscape, the lush, spacious gardens, and the Filipino heritage cuisine.

R U D E!! it's actually our first time eating here and our experience was disappointing because of the staffs we are never coming back! we were aiming to...eat at balay dako or bag of beans or antonios but puno lahat so we ended up trying this pamana restaurant since walang tao naman, Which is a very wrong choice

we went to the restaurant at around 12nn (december 2,2020) the parking boy was very good he actually assisted us but when we went in the receptionist just said "" pwede napo pumasok"" and did not assist us she even got my mother so mad because my mother kept on saying we wanted a table na magkakatabi kami because it's OUR ONLY TIME na kumpleto! receptionist said na ""wala wala ""di pwede blabla, we know na dapat social distancing what we are requesting is atleast isang helerang table kahit magkakahiwalay duhhhh, we were 7pax btw. they gave us magkkahiwalay na table at first tapos yung nakagreen na naglalagay ng water was very bastos!! super!!! my mom said to the receptionist bakit yung katabing table magkakatabi sila. and all the receptionist is saying is ""wala na wala na"" 

but! merong waiter na hinelp kami he was superb!!! he was the only one who actually calmed the situation binigyan nya kami ng table sa taas where in we can eat as a whole family. Thank you kuya waiter! sorry we were'nt able to get the name of the staffs because we wanted to bond. He's the only one who served as so we gave him almost 2000 pesos as a tip alone because of his effort i hope your co workers are like you. Mabilis mag isip and magresolve ng situation.

okay so we are all settled in ok na so i went to the cr downstairs the receptionist and si ateng tagapour ng water was talking about what happened and yung mom ko sa RECEPTION AREA wherein a lot of people can hear it, they were laughing about the situation ,So i told them kung paguusapan nyo yung nangyare or chismis please kayo kayo nalang wag yung ibang may nakakarinig. 

SO SI KUYANG WAITER LANG ANG KUMAUSAP samin and nagsorry and tbh wala syang kasalanan yung receptionist at yung nakagreen ang bastos e. Not even yung manager supervisor ang lumapit samin to talk about what happened. üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ si kuya waiter na mabait included sa picture down below thanks kuya again. Godbless you kuya waiter

We arrived as a group of 15...and there was a group of 20 ahead of us, but we were seated in about 30 mins. The lady at the reception was kind enough to recommend some other restaurants around Tagaytay (probably because we all look famished!), but this kind gesture made us stay. They serve all the favorite dishes in the Philippines, from Luzon to Mindanao, so it's practically a one stop dining experience. I highly recommend the humba, the seafood kare-kare, the sinigang na kamyas, and tuna belly. They have the all time favorite snacks and desserts so you can eat at your hearts content. Also, the ginger pandan ice tea is really good stuff. Staff is very friendly. The food arrived in a reasonable time and served together.

The sausages were cold and the bacon was more hard than crispy, the effect that you get when grease hardens when cold. So i waited for more...than 40 mins only to get served cold food. I am assuming while the other components of my order was being prepared, they cooked the bacon and sausages in batches and would just get some as orders came in. So by the time they processed my order, the bacon and sausages that i got were cold. The restaurant was 80% capacity so it was not even at their limits. The restaurant is a converted house so i suspect the kitchen doesn't have the capacity to serve a restaurant of that size so they made shortcuts in the preparation. Even then i had to wait for more than 40 minutes. For 450 bucks for the dish, I was expecting more. A that price point, I'd give other options a try.

Unfortunately, Concha‚Äôs is no longer accepting customers so we opt for other restos in the area and we saw Buon Giorno. What amazed me here is the interior of the resto. It‚Äôs homey though it needs more space. What also impressed me is their unlimited bread which I think is freshly baked italian bread. So if you are quite hungry while waiting for your food, you can have the bread first. It was served hot, covered with cloth to preserved its freshness and hotness and it is in a small basket.

Lime & Basil,4.0,"March 22, 2023",A Very Nice Find,"We visited on the recommendation of a few friends and weren't disappointed. We sat in the tented more open area. Whilst it might not be as smart as inside the main restaurant, that didn't matter as this area had a really nice laid-back feel to...it.

We had three dishes, all of which were nice. At first I was worried about how red the red curry was, but it had great flavours and the chicken was really moist.

The staff were slightly slow on taking orders and never seemed to be looking at us when we were trying to get their attention. That said, they were pleasant enough.

Slightly on the expensive side for what we had but well worth it and will definitely put this on our return list.",Date of visit:,/ShowUserReviews-g1956909-d6211646-r883100190-Lime_Basil-Alfonso_Cavite_Province_Calabarzon_Region_Luzon.html

I have been searching for it for a few years when I lived in the states but could never find it anywhere. When I saw it was on the menu here I had to order it.

Restaurant Verbena,3.0,"April 18, 2019","Overpriced, average food","Tried their plated breakfast that came with the hotel package.  We were allowed to select one among the choices on top of a selection of assorted fruits, bread, juices, milk, coffee/tea/hot chocolate.  The portion was just right to make one full, although taste and quality...were pretty average.  The hot chocolate was no longer ""hot"" when served so I requested it to be warmed.  Pitchers of fruit juices were dipped in water, not ice and there were no ice dispensers around, so just imagine drinking them at room temperature.  The assorted fruits were limited in variety.  The mangoes were overripe.  

Tried also their dinner on the night we checked in.  The restaurant barely had any other guests except us at about half past 6.  There were more selections in the menu, but rather pricey and thus not commensurate to the food quality/taste.  

The restaurant was clean and offered a nice view of the lake.  But it lacked the ambience and coziness of a fine dining restaurant.",Date of visit:,/ShowUserReviews-g317121-d1739657-r667389812-Restaurant_Verbena-Tagaytay_Cavite_Province_Calabarzon_Region_Luzon.html

We decided to just eat in and avoid the Saturday evening Tagaytay traffic.

The complimentary rolls are fresh off the oven, soft and sweet.

The kids enjoyed the basket of fries.  My son...had the Fish and Chips and boxed the leftovers since the serving was big.

My daughter and I shared the Lechon Kawali which was done perfectly.  The skin was crunchy why the meat melts in your mouth.

My wife had the Salpicao though it was a bit to sweet and the tenderloin used had some tendon.

We didn‚Äôt have dessert as we decided to walk next door for some coffee and pastries.

Breakfast the next day was just as superb.  My daughter had the corned beef while my son had the eggs benedict and both were happy.

Restaurant Verbena,5.0,"July 23, 2018",Dine With a View at the Restaurant Verbena,"Am so excited to share our dining experience and how we went a little lavish enjoying a full board meal at the Restaurant Verbena, that‚Äôs critically lauded as one of the ‚Äòbest restaurants in Tagaytay‚Äò, and we were so thrilled then to indulge ourselves.

Oh...dear!  It has been an ultimate dining experience for a foodie family like us!  Every dish was beautifully served with locally sourced and farm-fresh ingredients.  As you scroll down the page of this blog, get ready to feast your eyes and drool over these mouthwatering food photos that am very much excited to share with you.
And oh, we soooo love the fresh air and green surroundings with a magnificent view of the Taal Lake!

Indeed, it‚Äôs been a happy family day that we have a happy appetite too to savour the hearty and healthy dishes that was served to us for Lunch.

We‚Äôve picked a variety of best sellers from the a la carte menu, and this large hot pot filled with flavorful, soft, melty mozzarella cheese as a dip to a warm focaccia have kick start our appetite!

Is there anything more soothing than a bowl of this reach and creamy soup?

It was also nice to add some more greens to balance our plate with a delicious and fresh salad‚Ä¶

This cheesy Prawns Termidor is truly a seafood delight!

I‚Äôve always been a fan of Ribeye Steak, and the tender melt in your mouth of this decadent cut of steak is so worthy of the price!

The salmon skin on top of the dish is so crisp, and the pink fillet is so rich and buttery!

My little spaghetti monster had a full plate of this all for himself!  üòâ

A taste of Filipino-style cheesecake in a richer,creamier, and cheesier way!

Chocolate lovers‚Ä¶ this warm, ooey, gooey chocolate chip cookie topped with vanilla bean ice cream is perfect for you!

Oh dear, we‚Äôve eaten quite a large meal that we ended up stuffed after an indulgent lunch, so we got sleepy and took some siesta time (afternoon nap)!

Then came the evening, a Set Dinner for 2 with a 4-course meal awaited us.

We started off with the Soup of the Day- Asparagus Cream Soup ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs pure comfort in a bowl üòâ

This deliciously succulent Barramundi is made more delectable with butter sauce and served on top of Edamame. I shared this plate with my little boy, and he loved it as well too üôÇ

While the husband enjoyed this juicy and incredibly tender Braised Beef, the little boy liked the taste of the veggie side dish!

Sigh we‚Äôd love to try the Panna Cotta though the restaurant had run out of it.  Instead, we had this sweet and smooth baked custard Creme Flan.

The next day, we were so excited to start the day having an exceptionally good Country Breakfast‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve always believed that when eating a balanced breakfast, you‚Äôll surely have a better morning üòâ

And oh, may I say this in Tagalog, ‚ÄúGustung-gusto ko talaga ang manga!‚Äù  I just love eating mango regardless if it is green or ripe üòâ

Me and my husband got excited as we‚Äôve been served with a warm, thick, bittersweet Tsokolate de Batirol and a perfect pair of Hot Pandesal with Coconut Jam spread.  A variety of freshly baked breads and pastries are so delicious too!

Since we woke up a bit late, we decided to pick the Mains from the Country Breakfast Menu.

My husband had this perfectly marinated tender Beef Tapa that went well with garlic fried rice and fried egg.

‚Ä¶and for myself, it may not be ideal, but I couldn‚Äôt miss not having this all time favorite Filipino breakfast, Garlic Longganisa!

It has been priceless moments to bring our family together over good food and meaningful conversations.

Balinsasayaw Restaurant,4.0,"January 10, 2019",Needs Consistency in Quality & Service,"First time that my family had lunch here was a clear win for a 5-star rating. Everything that we ordered were satisfying and gave us a delightful experience.  That caused us to dine there again, albeit we did not have the same experience.

There were...relatively more customers than our first visit so we just ordered the same combo meals for each for easy preparation and then ordered other dishes ala carte. First disappointment was the waiting time, which is almost 45 minutes. Second was the serving size in which the three got almost the same sizes while mine was obviously only about half of what was served to the rest. Third was the fresh lumpia with my daughter's share having a sour taste.  She tried mine and it tastes different.  They replaced it but with the same sour taste unlike what was served to me which was ok. Then the very disappointing fresh buko which we followed up since our meals were served but we are already about to finish and no fresh buko has arrived.  Calling the waiter for the last time, the waiter said everyone in the kitchen was busy and nobody can prepare the fresh buko for us. But we saw a couple of waiters bringing fresh buko at other tables after I talked to the waiter. 

I demanded that our drinks be replaced with a new one, free of charge, because it was not an issue of being out of stock but an issue of nobody can prepare, meaning it is still available.  The manager gave us free drinks and apologized.

Food is great and gives you value for your money.  But only if they will be consistent in their quality and service.

Siglo Modern Filipino,4.0,"March 26, 2022",A Restaurant That Cares,"Siglo is the in-house restaurant of the charming View Park Hotel.  It prides itself with the use of local ingredients for dishes that hail from Luzon to Mindanao.  We had breakfast here for three days since we were booked at View Park Hotel which included...breakfast in our package.  Breakfast was plated a la carte with rice, eggs and a main viand such as bacon, tapa, daing na bangus, etc.

During our first night, we had dinner at Siglo since we just wanted a quiet & relaxing place to have dinner after a long drive from Manila.  We ordered grilled St. John's fish (Tilapia) with a side dish of tomatoes and onions and fresh young coconut (buko) juice served straight from the coconut.  We enjoyed our meal that we decided to just have dinner there for the next two nights we were in Tagaytay and try their other dishes.  We were not disppointed, in fact we enjoyed the laing and pinakbet that we ordered during the succeeding nights.  

Their serving is good for two persons.  We would order only one dish since the serving was sufficient for the two of us.  Had we ordered another dish there would definitely be left overs.  And we would not have fully enjoyed the savory laing and pinakbet and the grilled tilapia.  

The tilapia was grilled superbly without any signs of blood.  It was juicy and not overly grilled and dry.  The laing had just the right spicy kick without burning your palate and the coconut cream and the yam (gabi) leaves gave the right texture to the dish.  And the pinakbet was a complete dish with mixed vegetables (squash, okra, egg plant,bitter gourd (ampalaya) etc.)and pork bagnet in shrimp paste (bagoong alamang, Ilocanos would usually use anchovy sauce or ginamos).  Each meal with drinks averaged PHP700-800.  We charged our dinners to our room and settled it with a credit card upon checking out of View Park Hotel.

Service was prompt (unlike other reviews mentioning a long wait) probably because since we were booked at View Park Hotel, we placed our orders  two hours before our meal. I think they cook your chosen dish when you order it, thus keeping it fresh.  While waiting for their order, guests could just chit chat or look around and take pictures at the different instagrammable spots of View Park Hotel.  Food attendants were also constantly looking out if we had needs to be attended to.  

While we were dining there, there were only around two other tables that were occupied.  The tables and chairs had that antique feels in keeping up with its name, Siglo.  One table even had an antique sewing machine as its base.  The chairs and benches had hard wood without any cushions so it could be quite a killer on your butt if you wait a long time for your meal.  Probably they could have cushions on some of the chairs so that patrons could choose whether they want to sit on hard wood or on cushioned chairs.

While the dishes were excellent, I feel they have to work a little bit on their beverages.  As previously mentioned, on our first night we had buko juice straight from the coconut.  The juice was refreshing but I felt that the juice came from a matured coconut.  After drinking the juice, we requested that the coconut be broken open so that we could get to the coconut meat.  I was right that the coconut was mature and the meat was not soft and slushy as young coconuts would be.  Perhaps, they should choose their coconuts more judiciously or get a more reliable buko (young coconut) supplier.

On our second night,  we chose to have cucumber shake.   Cucumber is light and refreshing but when it is a shake it becomes a bit heavy and when I sipped the shake about a  fifth of the glass was ice sludge with cucumber residue.  Cucumber juice with kalamansi and honey would have been more satisfying to me.

The service staff professionally attended to the diners.  Rico, the restaurant manager trained his staff well.  In fact, while we were having breakfast, we overheard him emphasizing to the new trainees the value of punctuality.   He said that they should be there fifteen minutes before the appointed time so that they could have a little time to prepare themselves for their shift.

I felt that Rico could probably talk to his staff outside the dining area out of the earshot of diners.  Some diners might misinterpret the training negatively.  But for a training practitioner like me, I felt that the trainees are lucky to have a restaurant manager who is committed and cares to train and guide them.

Overall I would give Siglo a high rating and would endorse it to diners who are in the Tagaytay area for a quiet, relaxing and satisfying meal.",Date of visit:,/ShowUserReviews-g317121-d10587784-r832406943-Siglo_Modern_Filipino-Tagaytay_Cavite_Province_Calabarzon_Region_Luzon.html

Siglo Modern Filipino,4.0,"September 19, 2021",Enjoying local delicacies,"The competition is quite tight in Tagaytay (with so many restaurants and eateries to choose from) and tourists may not know where to go to try some of our very own local dishes. I would personally recommend Siglo Modern Filipino restaurant. The place is a...bit old, but its aged ambiance adds to the beauty of the place. It reminds of our old ancestral house. Anyway, given the restrictions and health protocols nowadays, indoor dining can accommodate only about a dozen people at a time. The menu had a long list of local (Filipino) dishes representing the different regions of the country. I tried their ""bulalo,"" crispy pork ""binagoongan,"" and ""binagoongan rice."" Our order was served some 30mins later. We really didn't mind waiting for we knew that the foods had to be cooked fresh and besides we enjoyed exploring the nearby Siglo Brew caf√© and View Park Hotel in the meantime. It was worth the wait for the foods tasted great. Compared with other restaurants in the area, the prices here are very modest.

Passing by the veranda of this resto, I've seen there are 2 tables that are vacant without ""reserved"" sign on the table. Then that guy in blue polo shirt approached us and asked how many were we.

Rowena's Cafe,1.0,"August 29, 2019",Never Again!,"Never Again!
We had a horrible experience here last Sunday May 30, 2019. On our way home from an overnight trip at Tali beach our large group of 10 decided to make a stop in Tagaytay to grab coffee. Our first and 2nd choice were...jam packed so we ended up at cliffhouse and decided to settle here. 

It took a long time for our orders to arrive. I ordered for pansit bihon and white chocolate mocha 16oz. The first batch of coffee we ordered arrived. Then when the waiter called for who ordered white chocolate mocha I raised my hand, but I noticed how come my cup was placed in an 8oz cup when I ordered for 16oz. The waiter seemed annoyed and he told me that for white chocolate mocha the 16oz cup is placed in an 8oz cup. This made no sense to me at all. It was only then that one of my friend said she ordered for the white chocolate mocha small which is the 8oz cup. So I immediately pass the drink to her. All of my friend‚Äôs coffee already arrived except for mine. 

A few minutes later, the waiter came out with a cup of 16oz then he asked who ordered for hot chocolate? I said I ordered for white chocolate mocha 16oz and I did not order for the hot chocolate. And I told the waiter to cancel my WCM. After awhile he came back at our table looking annoyed and was screaming to us saying ‚Äúmeron po talagang nag order nito for Sheila!‚Äù I was shocked that he had to mention my name out loud announcing like I just didn‚Äôt want to accept my order. So I told the waiter, ‚ÄúKuya yes, I am Sheila and I made an order but not for hot chocolate. Why would I accept a wrong order?! Besides, I‚Äôve already cancelled that drink.‚Äù While some of my friends just wanted me to let it slide saying ‚Äúhayaan mo na‚Äù The whole situation got me too annoyed so I said ‚Äúhello? I‚Äôm the paying customer ako pa ba mag aadjust?‚Äù Cliffhouse is known to have quality restaurants and coffee shops within its compound. Not being petty here but, I expect some level of service to go with their menu prices. We noticed, the group from our next table all stood up and left because no one was attending to them. 

The persistent waiter came out again in a few minutes with the 16oz messy cup and putting it down in front of me saying here‚Äôs your white chocolate mocha (ugh! I said to cancel it already) but fine, never mind. I removed the lid to take a sip and my God! It‚Äôs obviously the hot chocolate drink from earlier that they tried to remedy to make it pass as a WCM. I know how a WCM taste like. But to be sure, I passed the drink to my friend who ordered for the same and she confirmed it‚Äôs a different drink. 

When I saw the guy who took our orders coming out of the kitchen, I think he‚Äôs not just an order taker but he was also the one who prepared our food. I immediately called him and I talked to him calmly and told him. Kuya, this isn‚Äôt a WCM. Just to let you know that I am not paying for this drink. The guy told me sure maam no problem and he took the cup away. 

Upset and hungry, I ate my pansit and it tasted like a lot of soy sauce was poured over it. The pansit tasted bad even when I‚Äôm hungry. 

When my friends asked for the bill ‚Äúkuya pa bill out na rin.‚Äù the same waiter responded in his same annoyed tone ‚Äúma‚Äôam wait lang!‚Äù My friend lost it and told him ‚Äú ok kuya! May problema ka ba? Ano bang problema mo? You can say it nicely Ang ayos kung nag ask sayo.!‚Äù I think this waiter can‚Äôt take this level of stress that he doesn‚Äôt realize he‚Äôs already screaming at us numerous times. It‚Äôs a Sunday. Rowena‚Äôs should‚Äôve anticipated the volume of people and should‚Äôve assigned a few more staff that day. Your waiter is so stressed out we are just a group of 10 and the other group already left and they can‚Äôt even cope. 

And my god asking for our bill took another 20 minutes. It was chaos when the lady cashier doesn‚Äôt seem to know what she was doing. Oh and they asked for Sevice charge pa ha. I wanted to ask ‚Äúwhich service?‚Äù But nah, never mind. This will be our first and last to be visiting this place. We should‚Äôve just went to UCC next to it. Sorry no photos. No one would think of taking a photo when the place already ruined everyone‚Äôs mood at the table.",Date of visit:,/ShowUserReviews-g317121-d4102267-r704322883-Rowena_s_Cafe-Tagaytay_Cavite_Province_Calabarzon_Region_Luzon.html

We thought our foods can be served in less than 30 minutes because there are only 3-4 tables occupied during the time, and less customers ordering food because it's passed lunch time. I thought the loooong waiting game is over. 1 hour passed, and only 1 dish was served to our table. They didn't even served us water, which is a common practice in restaurants, that once the guests are seated to their respective tables, the servers will automatically serve a glass of water to their table.

The creaminess of the mixture combined with the soft but crunchy crust makes you looking for more! They have many other tart flavors available...too, but i only tasted their buko tart. Maybe next time, im willing to explore their other flavors.

The food itself was pretty good. It was clean and they did refill our bulalo soup for free, which was nice. The workers were nice and accommodating, but I didn't have a chance to really talk to them as someone else did the ordering.

We ordered the Boneless Bangus, Bulalo and Sizzling Gambas..

It took 20mins for our meal to arrive and when it finally reach our table they gave us the biggest and tasties boneless bangus that I have ever seen in my life check out the pic.

The Bulalo is also an absolute winner when they notice that the soup is already half full they will quickly refill the soup, the bulalo meat is also very tender and the vegetable is cooked just right..

I was not able to try tye sizzling gambas because of my allergy to shrimp but according to my wife it's tasty but the serving is not that generous you can clearly see from the pic.. we can buy a lot of prawns with the price of the gambas..

The price is just ok and the service is absolutely awesome.. I will always eat here with no hesitation whenever I'm in tagaytay.

If you're not planning to visit Vietnam soon, and you're looking for Vietnamese dishes to taste, and you're somewhere in Tagaytay, this place is worth a try.

Sample Bawai salad of coconut sprouts with glazed pork and steamed shrimps. Then Goi Cuon Bo (fresh rolls with mixed greens and lemongrass beef). For your soup, you can choose between Bun Bo Hue (beef and pork knuckle soup) or Pho Bo, the classic beef noodle soup.

For entrees, you can have Bo Luc Lac (tenderloin beef tips in Vietnamese spices with potato and sweet potato), Ca Kho To (caramelized fish with rice), and Curry Go (coconut-infused chicken curry with rice).

Another thing going in Bawai's favor is its quaint ambiance being located in a secluded part of town.

Its expanding clientele attests to its reputation as a dependable food corner. It has opened branches in White Plains, Quezon City; Nuvali, Sta. Rosa, Laguna; and Taguig City.

Bawai's Vietnamese Kitchen,5.0,"November 1, 2016",REAL GEM AND A TREASURE!!!!,"My wife and I were invited to have dinner in this Excellent Restaurant by the daughter of the owner.  Admittedly if you try to find this place at night it can be daunting as the road from the Tagaytay main road is not well lighted...and yes Waze does help for sure.  But in spite of this, I liken the 'adventure' to find the place like a Treasure Hunt and WOW what a treasure at the end!!  I cannot really convey how super great this place is.  The food quality, the ambiance (its actually the house of the owners), the feeling of eating excellent Vietnamese food at home.  I love that NOT commercial feeling in the place and the food.  My wife swears by the food as 'worth dying' for.  And we are not saying this just because the daughter of the owner invited us and also was there to sit with us, I mean what we ordered was in the menu and not something special made just for us.  As I write this my mouth is watering thinking of the food.  And like the coffee at the end of the meal.....HEAVEN!!!!!!  My wife and I love this place and will definitely be back for more.  I will swear by this place and recommend this place to everyone for sure.  For those of you who want to try this place, I believe you have to make a reservation as this is NOT some commercial place with tons of seating, it is the house of the owner and what I saw sitting would be for like maybe at most 30 (or even less).  But as I said really really worth it.  It is accessible from Tagaytay, the main road - of you come up to Tagaytay from the Sta. Rosa route, turn right heading towards Tagaytay proper, about 500 meters or so after you turn, you will see a road that you can turn right with a landmark I think is the Dominican Sisters, go down that road for about 1.5 km and then you will see a sign which you can turn right on and there you are.  Another landmark would be Buena Vista Tagaytay or if you know about Chateau Hesita it also has the same route as Bawai's.

Bawai's Vietnamese Kitchen,4.0,"September 21, 2016",Home-cooked Vietnamese food,"On the way to Tagaytay, we stopped to have lunch here. Based on reviews, I must say this place is a hidden gem. It's located inside a residential area, off-road. Part of the area was converted into a semi-outdoor dining while the cooking mostly done...in the kitchen inside the house. Some of the foods we ordered were: Goi Cuon (fresh spring rolls with shrimp), Tom Rang Me (grilled prawns with tamarind paste), Pho Bo (beef noodle soup), Com Suon Cha (grilled pork belly). I must say, we ordered a lot for a party of 2 - foodies at heart! Here's the verdict:

The spring rolls were ok. Nothing fancy but the peanut sauce was good.
Grilled prawns - the prawns were fresh and the tamarind sauce was good! Order rice.
Pork belly - tasty. What really hit the spot was their homemade sauce - it's a fish sauce that's not too sweet nor too salty but perfect for their pork belly; they can even use this dip for their spring rolls!
The Pho was good - you can really taste the beef stock. We didn't get to finish this because we were busy trying out the other meals.

Overall, this restaurant is good for couples and families who need a break from the usual Metro Manila-based restaurants in Tagaytay.",Date of visit:,/ShowUserReviews-g3387417-d2186174-r420768771-Bawai_s_Vietnamese_Kitchen-Silang_Cavite_Province_Calabarzon_Region_Luzon.html

Antonio's Garden,5.0,"November 11, 2022",One of the best dining experiences of my life !!!!,"The plan was to go and have a steak main course and nothing else as we had done nothing but eat far too much during the previous week.

Our plans soon went array! As soon as you arrive, you get that feeling that this is...indeed a very special place and that perhaps you should indulge to get the full benefit.

The original one course idea turned into six courses.......all of which were cooked to perfection and sublime in every way.

Veal bone marrow with pecorino to start was rich, packed with favour and truly unctuous.

A small salad of strawberries, radish, walnut and blue cheese followed, this unassuming salad was packed with surprises, every mouthful, another taste explosion. As salads go this was a masterclass.

The lightest clam chowder followed. Intense and fishy without that usual chowder heaviness.

Next a pineapple palate cleanser- I admit I am not actually a fan of sorbet/granita as a palate cleanser, but this was packed to the rafters with intense pineapple flavours.

Dry aged rib eye followed; it was exquisite. The multiply accompaniments were a classy touch - Hollandaise, burnt onion sauce, chilli flakes and pickled garlic all added another dimension to every slice of that very happy cow (sadly/or happily departed depending on your viewpoint).

After five courses there really is not much point in avoiding dessert. Chocolate and olive cake with honeycomb and ice cream and the Italian version of 'floating islands' were just to die for.

The last time I ate this well was at Gordon Ramsey, Hospital Road over ten years ago. I've been trying to decide which was better and, in my opinion, they are now both in my top 1.

In summary, an exceptional dining experience and one which I will remember for many years, the food was so well executed and perfect that I felt emotional.

The Ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel, Anthony, took excellent care of us and was a very pleasant person to meet - and meet again.

As appetizer, our daughter chose the Baked Burrata in Phyllo while my wife and I enjoyed the excellent, and very generous, P√¢t√© de Foie Gras. For the main course my wife chose the Akaroa Salmon Wellington, while my daughter and I enjoyed sharing the Angus Rib Eye Steak. The quality, taste and presentation of all dishes was truly excellent - the best we have ever experienced in the Philippines, and well on par with the best Europe can offer.

All main courses are in themselves generously sized, and additionally come with a salad, a soup, a delicious mini-scoop of cucumber and mint sorbet, a dessert and coffee - so you certainly will not leave hungry! To celebrate the special day we enjoyed sharing a bottle of Italian Prosecco which went very well with our meal choices.

I was curious, being an Ilonggo, as to how a place with an Ilonggo name came to be in Tagaytay where...Tagalog is spoken. When we arrived at Balay Dako, we were very impressed by the size of the place. Balay Dako means large (dako) house (balay) in Ilonggo. The setting was just beautiful and the grounds and building were very well kept. It was meant to be reminiscent of a large family house from decades past. Luckily, we were there on a Tuesday afternoon and we were able to avoid the usual weekend crowds. I would estimate that it only took us about 20 to 25 minutes to get seated at a table by the window with a great view of Taal. The menu can be deceiving since we order kare kare and kansi amongst other dishes. The size of the bowl was very large and was full. I travelled all the way from Iloilo just to try one of the best kansi that I have ever tried. The servers were very attentive to our every need. The service at Balay Dako was great.

Balay Dako,4.0,"May 24, 2023",Nice meal and views,"We came down to Tagaytay just to have lunch here. We didn't book and were able to get a table without too long of a wait. The carpark is fairly big and is just off the highway, keep an eye out for the signs. We...perused the deli while waiting for a table and they had quite an interesting range of items. On the way to the table we went past the ice cream display as well as the grill where they were making piaya. 
The dining room was quite large and the window outside looks out to the water and the Taal volcano. We grabbed a few items to share. Most of the items were quite tasty. I quite like the lechon kawali with the tender meat and crispy skin. The sisig was also nice as was the squid rings. The kansi with the banana flower was interesting but not to my liking. For dessert, we did try the taho ice cream which was very interesting. It was almost like taho but creamy. The halo halo was nice but the palitaw was quite bland.
It was a nice place for tasty Filipino food and the views were quite good.",Date of visit:,/ShowUserReviews-g317121-d8587297-r891703251-Balay_Dako-Tagaytay_Cavite_Province_Calabarzon_Region_Luzon.html
Balay Dako,2.0,"April 22, 2023",My last visit,"Just had lunch there, my 2nd visit, and I have to say will be my last. Since nothing changed from our last visit.

The place is overpriced for the quality of the food & overall taste. We could've eaten in other places at a fraction...of the price we paid and still got a better food quality.

1. Eventhough it is the summer and the temp reaches to about 34 degrees, I still expect the Bulalo to be served steaming hot. Ours was warm to almost room temp.

2. Server took the time to refill the water on our table. It's not even lunch service where everything is chaotic.

3. Parking attendants let cars in when there are no parking spaces, hence, those that need to leave, can't because the cars are blocking the way.

4. Although they have a ramp going into the dining area, I still consider the place not wheelchair friendly as the dining tables are placed close to each other making it difficult to manuever the wheelchair. You may need to ask other guest to stand up or make room for you.

The good side, though:

1. The food was served maybe 10 or 15 mins after we placed our order.

2. The server was more attentive after I complained.

Of all the restaurants by Antonio's group of restaurants, this is my least favorite.

Guests are more likely to pay for the name rather than the food quality.",Date of visit:,/ShowUserReviews-g317121-d8587297-r887207708-Balay_Dako-Tagaytay_Cavite_Province_Calabarzon_Region_Luzon.html

Food is abundant and all were tasty.  You will get full.  Guaranteed!  The staff offered us tarragon with berry tea.  Never had this before.  The aroma is sweet and smooth to sip.  I had seconds!

Was expecting some kind of oasis full of plants flowers and trees. Was expecting good food but what we got was the...worst lunch buffet we have ever tried. The buffet had two types of spaghetti and chicken breast. Thats it. The waiters make sure to serve you the food on your table rather than you get it at the buffet table in an attempt to cut back on the portions. We were a table of 5 but they only put down two small plates of chicken breasts for our lunch. They say its eat all you can but they are definitely trying to regulate how much you eat. 

We wanted to order from the menu because we didnt like the buffet offering but the waiters said that we had to eat the buffet. 

Dont waste your time on this place. I think the public knows this is a place to avoid because there were very few people dining there. I guess we were the only out of town suckers that day.

Breakfast at Antonio's,3.0,"August 25, 2023",Antonio's Bfast Experience..,"Come early if you want to get seated immediately.
Plan your orders before arriving so you can give them to the staff after getting seated. Serving may take a while if the place is already full.
The basket of bread was good, but a little...expensive (350) because it was just maybe 2 pandesal, 2 loaves of bread, some stick bread, and some jam&butter.
If you order sausages with your pancakes, make sure to check if it's cooked well once your it's served because ours was not. 
If the weather's not that cold or too hot, don't agree to get seated on their garden area. There's lots of mosquitos too in the garden. Their garden area could be improved to get your money's worth because you're paying for meals that are extra pricey (e.g. extra sunny side up is more than 100 if I recall it right.
When you order coffee, make sure to inform the server you want it served hot, not luke warm. My capuccino was just warm, almost same with the weather that day. Again, maybe because the serving takes a while that's why food arrives not too hot/warm.

Breakfast at Antonio's,3.0,"June 8, 2023",Long wait for soso food,Went to magnolia branch. Wow at 10:00 we were 6th on the list. Had to kill time at the mall first. Why the hype ?

Pancake house is better. My brother had the freah corned beef which was ok. Another had tapa. Just so. Another had the beef ribs which was humingous but i did not try it. Over all i would have gone  somewhere else for brunch. The crew however were very attentive to the titas of manila crowd. The bread and piaya were very good though.

The place was a bit dark surrounded by small lights here and there and it was surrounded by lush greeneries and other vegetation. We were escorted to our table and room looks like a very old house that has been slightly refurbished to maintain its old look. But personally didnt like the feel as it was kinda creepy that night.

As for the food, it was a set meal intended to be consumed whether you dont feel like eating an appetizer or a dessert for that matter. I ordered the big fat slab of grilled pork chop which was too much for me to finish.

Yes, a minimum price approx ¬£11 for a three course meal - that is very reasonable - and it is quality rather than quantity.

Nanay Cirilas Kapeng Barako,5.0,"March 7, 2019",Home in every bite,"One of the best dinners we have ever had!

Now there's another place we can call home in Tagaytay! From the amazing hospitality and culinary passions of Tita Medy, the Chef / Owner, and her Staff -- to the delicious food, Nanay Cirila's Kapeng Barako...will let you feel that every dish is humbly yet passionately made from home. 

It is very special because all the dishes are unique yet the deliciousness are all heartwarming ly familiar. 

We ordered the following:

Appetizer: Butter Shrimps
=Nicely done üëå Shrimps are indeed buttery soft, garlicky but subtle. Ain instant favorite. A must-try!

Beef: Bulalo
=One of the best I've tasted! Not a single bit of that oily or ma-sebo soup. They patiently remove the oily stuff so all you get is the tenderest beef and most flavorful broth. With fresh veggies too! Yum! Theirs is the only Bulalo we will eat from now on.

Pork: Grilled Liempo
=Another hit!  Soft and just the right balance of flavors/seasoning. And the ""ihaw"" taste is right. You know they grilled it using good firewood, (not with kerosene or plastic!). 

Fish: Crispy Daing na Bangus
=Fresh, well seasoned, crispy and no ""gilik"" taste. Just the way you want your bangus to be. 

Veggies: Fresh Lumpia Gulay
=Joy!!! Just JOY! The generous vegetables inside this Lumpia with it's peanuty sauce will make you smile! One order is not enough!

Dessert: Halo-Halo
=There's a special twist that i would like to share but you better discover this by yourself. The Ube Ice Cream is good, but the ""twist"" elevates it to an ""Aha! That works fabulously!"" experience.

Beverages: Hot Tarragon Herb Tea & Brewed Iced Tea with Calamansi
=Nothing artificial here. They are all natural, all fresh.

Truly a gem in Tagaytay! 

Do contact them and discover the flavors for yourselves! And a wonderful chat with Tita Medy makes everything heartwarming. I'm so happy to have met her and now call her a friend.

The place looked nice and the servers were very accommodating.

Negatives: Everything else

We ordered Uni Sashimi, Spicy Salmon Maki, California Maki, Miso Ramen, and their grilled us beef (forgot the exact name)

Uni sashimi tasted bland and old. The vegetables...that came with it wasn't fresh as well. Both Makis were just meh. Could compare it to something bought in the frozen section of an SM grocery. Ramen wasn't hot, tasted like instant ramen, and not the good kind. Grilled beef was basically beef tapa. Wasn't hot at all; as the name would suggest it would have been grilled. Felt like I ate something that was cooked earlier and microwaved for my pleasure üôÑ

It's been part of our milestones -- family trips, birthdays, reunions, date nights and even just random dinners. When we just want comfort food, we're here. We've seen it evolve over the decades and coming...here is like visiting an old friend for us. 

The food is always a hit - Chef Paul knows good steak. But his non-meat options are also just as good when you need variety. 

Much has been said about the service and we experience it too, as servers come and go. Our longtime favorite waiter retired and was recently replaced by new faces. There is a learning curve on the service but we are forgiving and don't let it deter us from the experience. We're here to enjoy a good meal not stress over the servers.

We always order:
- Blackened Beef Salad
- Tuna Salad
- Truffle Mushroom Pasta
- Ribeye
- Prawns with Angel Hair Pasta
- Pineapple Carpaccio

So YES. Obviously we recommend, despite the hundreds of new restaurants in Tagaytay, we've kept coming back. If a restaurant could be a home, this would be ours.

First of all, the striploin is good. I just wish that the server...should know how to listen, it seems like he make things complicated and he made us feel we don't know how to order a steak (lol) this is very basic as far as i know. What is exactly ON THE SIDE or what esle do you want to add for your side dish. So we had this kind of a conversation about the side orders, the server keep on saying that there is already ""INCLUSIVE"" side dish, but all we wanted was to add, and i literally went to the point i don't want to talk anymore, and gave a signal to my sister, i'm done with this conversation because i'm hungry, we travel from pampanga to tagaytay. 

To the server, i hope you will able to read this. You know who you are, please try to improve your PR, i actually don't like when they say ""FIRST IMPRESSIONS, LAST"" but definitely, NEVER AGAIN.

Fire Lake Grill,5.0,"April 12, 2022",A great view deserves great food.,"It has been a while since we visited Tagaytay. The pandemic really wrought havoc on our travel and date plans. Finally, on a weekend, we finally took the chance.

We found out about Fire Lake Grill thanks to Google. It was one of the top...search results. We were giddy to arrive.

The place was non-descript, nestled in the Cliffhouse Tagaytay. We almost drove past it. But the area was wide and we were able to park without much difficulty. Just a note: validate your parking ticket lest you want to pay gold for a few hours of parking.

We arrived and Kim, our server, welcomed us warmly and accosted us to our seats: right in front of us is a stunning view of Taal lake and volcano. Since we were famished, we started off with the Seared Tuna Salad Nicoise-style and Mushroom and Pumpkin Soups. The tuna was seated perfectly, with a nice blend of spices crusted around it. The Pumpkin soup was thick and creamy, bringing out the flavors even more.

The entr√©es were the stars of the show. A masterpiece of a TENDERloin, a juicy ribeye and a succulent lamb shank. Not to mention, a delectable saffron and herb risotto. The lamb and risotto was a perfect pair.

And to top it all off, the desserts. Tasty vanilla caramel cake and chocolate cakes flanking the signature Fire Lake dessert: pinapple carpaccio. Coconut ice cream in a pastry cup on a bed of paper-thin slices of pineapple. Eat it together and the flavors just burst in your mouth. I added the lime peel and it even gave a greater dimension to the taste.

Overall, it was a terrific experience at Fire Lake Grill. Great service. Great food. Great view.

The food was excellent! Mom & my kids loved the touch of spice used to jazz up the pumpkin soup, and my husband & I found the grilled tomato soup very refreshing. The porterhouse steak was perfectly seasoned and cooked. The pan seared foie gras was so good that my daughter asked for a second serving! We also ordered pasta and risotto which were also nice.

Italian/Mexican/Filipino restaurant with 5-star TripAdvisor rating? My expectations were quite high. I arrived there to find a very average restaurant. Definitely not an Italian/Mexican restaurant...except by a huge stretch of the imagination. 

The food is so-so, with only the crispy tawilis really showing promise. Crispy pata was a bit tough and rice too expensive for the quality. The soup and arroz caldo were also mediocre. We wanted to order their flatbread pizza but it was out of stock, so there goes the Italian. 

The facilities were average, definitely not cozy as some have described. It's more or less properly maintained, but the washroom has a smell. 

There was only one other family aside from us in the restaurant. I had recommended this over Balay Dako due to its higher TripAdvisor ranking, but I definitely regret my decision and ended up making amends by visiting Balay Dako the following day.

I really didn't mind discovering and trying out new places, especially one like Voi La, which has a beautiful ambiance and a...good selection of food. As we stepped into this restaurant I was immediately impressed with its decors, furniture, colorful lanterns, and so forth. Not bad at all, I said to myself. Then I skimmed over its menu. It had a good selection of Italian, Spanish, Thai and Filipino dishes. My expectations were really high, considering that they were quite expensive. It's fine, I said, since you pay not only for the food, but for the ambiance, too. Well, the foods didn't disappoint, except that I found the servings rather small. Everything would have been forgiveable, but then our dining experience was dampened by a couple of things. First, service was too slow. Second, the waiters were not as accommodating as  they should be. They were nowhere to be found near our table and I had to rise many times just to look for them and call their attention. I asked for an extra fork and I had to ask for it thrice before they brought me one. The same thing happened when I asked again for the menu. The waiter serving us also took forever to give us the bill when we asked for it. Hayz! In the end, out of our dissatisfaction for such a lousy service, we decided not to leave them any tip. It's a pity that a lovely place with good food would have such a terrible customer service. I don't think I'd be returning to this restaurant any time soon.

Shambala Silang,1.0,"April 23, 2023","Worst Experience, Don‚Äôt waste your time. Go find somewhere else to go","Not worth visiting at all. You‚Äôre better off going someplace else. What a waste of beautiful space and environment. 

First - i asked them about the rates via Facebook Messenger and they said that the entrance fee is 200 and consumable with food. They did...not mention about the 500 minimum food requirement per person.

When we arrived, they started saying that the 200 per person entrance is only for the garden then we have to pay 300 for the food then we have to pay 200 for the gallery entrance fee. So in total we have to spend 700 pesos which we were not informed during our initial conversation in Facebook Messenger. The issue here is not the money, but the feeling that they did not tell us the prices early on during the fb messenger conversation. i felt that we were misinformed and coerced into going there by the premise that you can spend just 200 pesos. 

Second - They informed us that the food will take an hour to be served. This is okay since we did not pre-order and we can roam around while waiting for food. After 1.5 hours wala pa ring food. Even coke hindi pa din dumadating after 1.5 hours of ordering!. Hindi naman niluluto ang coke. Then the food arrived on by one and it was cold. We had to complain endlessly tapos saka lang sila nagmadali na i-release yung food.

Third - The Food also taste bland lalo na yung pasta dishes and pizza na parang frozen pizza lang. It was bad despite of it being pricey.

The crew apologized after our incessant complaints and gave us 1 complimentary ice cream cup per group. for me - the solution would have been to serve us the food on time as promised in one hour. that‚Äôs it. and please change your chef who cooks the western dishes. It was really bad.

Shambala Silang,5.0,"October 17, 2022",The place of PASSION and INSPIRATION,"Shambala is indeed a very amazing, interesting, and a perfect place for people who wants a peaceful and serene ambiance. I believe, the way the museum was designed is one factor that makes it unique but what‚Äôs more jaw dropping about it is the inspiration...and the overflowing passion of their one and only master, Ms. Riza Muyot. They are truly genuine in delivering an authentic experience and service. I remember the time we went there; they allowed us to feel and touch the hagabi: the bench in the middle of the Tawid Museum; it symbolizes wealth of the ifugaos. I was truly amazed! Every corner that your eyes lands on, there will be an artifact that is worth staring and the longer you see it you will eventually appreciate the beauty of an abstract art and its value. I would recommend for others to go check the place out and I, as well, I would definitely go back when I have a space in my time to free up my mind and have a wonderful and out of this world relax time!",Date of visit:,/ShowUserReviews-g3387417-d23511428-r864835954-Shambala_Silang-Silang_Cavite_Province_Calabarzon_Region_Luzon.html

Shambala Silang,5.0,"October 17, 2022",A Hidden Art Garden Paradise,"Shambala is a secret garden in Silang, Cavite that is named after a mythical Himalayan kingdom of peace and happiness. Among the lush garden is a Living Museum of modern Filipino Art,  Cordilleran culture, and slow-food Filipino cuisine. It's still under construction, but it's worth...a visit while most people haven't discovered this hidden paradise. You can choose which area of the garden you want to dine or relax in. There is plenty of space between guests. You are free to explore the garden on your own. You'll be surrounded by various bamboo varieties, flowering plants, bushes, ferns, overhanging vines, and tree species. Explore the second floor to learn about the owners' personal collection and become enthralled by the stories behind the various artworks. Shambala Silang was created and is curated by Riza Matibag Muyot. She is frequently in the garden grounds, to say hello and ask her about Shambala stories. The main Living Art Museum exhibits Cordilleran art, contemporary works by Filipino masters, and emerging works by young Filipino artists. The slopes on Shambala's hilly side are terraced, with foundations of rip-rapped tuffaceous stones made by true Cordilleran stone artisans.The authentic Dap-ay, where the tribal council meets with stone seats and a bonfire in the middle, is one of the Shambala Terraces' most impressive features.

Overall, we adore the art- and culture-inspired landscape, the lush, spacious gardens, and the Filipino heritage cuisine. This is a safe place to celebrate special occasions with the entire family, including grandparents and children. It's also an excellent location for retreats, and moments of self-reflection.",Date of visit:,/ShowUserReviews-g3387417-d23511428-r864821930-Shambala_Silang-Silang_Cavite_Province_Calabarzon_Region_Luzon.html

I love how Ms. Riza toured us around the gallery informing everything about Shambala from how they started it to how it is going now,...the theme which is the ""Cordillera in the South"". It is fascinating how they created the whole Shambala, how precisely Ms. Riza explained every art inside the gallery, her collection, her friends that are the artists of some masterpiece and I remember the four corners of Shambala Silang which is Creativity, Spirituality, Learning and Healing. 

I also love the food that is served to us, the Poqui-Poqui pizza, other gourmet foods, and the Maluca drinks and the violet one that really has me.

Pamana Restaurant,1.0,"January 3, 2021",WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER,"food is absolutely delicious and affordable but your waiters and staff even the receptionist are terrible!!! R U D E!! it's actually our first time eating here and our experience was disappointing because of the staffs we are never coming back! we were aiming to...eat at balay dako or bag of beans or antonios but puno lahat so we ended up trying this pamana restaurant since walang tao naman, Which is a very wrong choice

we went to the restaurant at around 12nn (december 2,2020) the parking boy was very good he actually assisted us but when we went in the receptionist just said "" pwede napo pumasok"" and did not assist us she even got my mother so mad because my mother kept on saying we wanted a table na magkakatabi kami because it's OUR ONLY TIME na kumpleto! receptionist said na ""wala wala ""di pwede blabla, we know na dapat social distancing what we are requesting is atleast isang helerang table kahit magkakahiwalay duhhhh, we were 7pax btw. they gave us magkkahiwalay na table at first tapos yung nakagreen na naglalagay ng water was very bastos!! super!!! my mom said to the receptionist bakit yung katabing table magkakatabi sila. and all the receptionist is saying is ""wala na wala na"" 

but! merong waiter na hinelp kami he was superb!!! he was the only one who actually calmed the situation binigyan nya kami ng table sa taas where in we can eat as a whole family. Thank you kuya waiter! sorry we were'nt able to get the name of the staffs because we wanted to bond. He's the only one who served as so we gave him almost 2000 pesos as a tip alone because of his effort i hope your co workers are like you. Mabilis mag isip and magresolve ng situation.

okay so we are all settled in ok na so i went to the cr downstairs the receptionist and si ateng tagapour ng water was talking about what happened and yung mom ko sa RECEPTION AREA wherein a lot of people can hear it, they were laughing about the situation ,So i told them kung paguusapan nyo yung nangyare or chismis please kayo kayo nalang wag yung ibang may nakakarinig. 

SO SI KUYANG WAITER LANG ANG KUMAUSAP samin and nagsorry and tbh wala syang kasalanan yung receptionist at yung nakagreen ang bastos e. Not even yung manager supervisor ang lumapit samin to talk about what happened. üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ si kuya waiter na mabait included sa picture down below thanks kuya again. Godbless you kuya waiter

The lady at the reception was kind enough to recommend some other restaurants around Tagaytay (probably because we all look famished!), but this kind gesture made us stay. They serve all the favorite dishes in the Philippines, from Luzon to Mindanao, so it's practically a one stop dining experience. I highly recommend the humba, the seafood kare-kare, the sinigang na kamyas, and tuna belly. They have the all time favorite snacks and desserts so you can eat at your hearts content.

The sausages were cold and the bacon was more hard than crispy, the effect that you get when grease hardens when cold. So i waited for more...than 40 mins only to get served cold food. I am assuming while the other components of my order was being prepared, they cooked the bacon and sausages in batches and would just get some as orders came in. So by the time they processed my order, the bacon and sausages that i got were cold. The restaurant was 80% capacity so it was not even at their limits. The restaurant is a converted house so i suspect the kitchen doesn't have the capacity to serve a restaurant of that size so they made shortcuts in the preparation. Even then i had to wait for more than 40 minutes. For 450 bucks for the dish, I was expecting more. A that price point, I'd give other options a try.

Unfortunately, Concha‚Äôs is no longer accepting customers so we opt for other restos in the area and we saw Buon Giorno. What amazed me here is the interior of the resto. It‚Äôs homey though it needs more space. What also impressed me is their unlimited bread which I think is freshly baked italian bread. So if you are quite hungry while waiting for your food, you can have the bread first. It was served hot, covered with cloth to preserved its freshness and hotness and it is in a small basket.

We had three dishes, all of which were nice. At first I was worried about how red the red curry was, but it had great flavours and the chicken was really moist.

The staff were slightly slow on taking orders and never seemed to be looking at us when we were trying to get their attention. That said, they were pleasant enough.

Pitchers of fruit juices were dipped in water, not ice and there were no ice dispensers around, so just imagine drinking them at room temperature.  The assorted fruits were limited in variety.  The mangoes were overripe.  

Tried also their dinner on the night we checked in.  The restaurant barely had any other guests except us at about half past 6.  There were more selections in the menu, but rather pricey and thus not commensurate to the food quality/taste.

My wife had the Salpicao though it was a bit to sweet and the tenderloin used had some tendon.

We didn‚Äôt have dessert as we decided to walk next door for some coffee and pastries.

Oh...dear!  It has been an ultimate dining experience for a foodie family like us!  Every dish was beautifully served with locally sourced and farm-fresh ingredients.  As you scroll down the page of this blog, get ready to feast your eyes and drool over these mouthwatering food photos that am very much excited to share with you.
And oh, we soooo love the fresh air and green surroundings with a magnificent view of the Taal Lake!

Indeed, it‚Äôs been a happy family day that we have a happy appetite too to savour the hearty and healthy dishes that was served to us for Lunch.

We‚Äôve picked a variety of best sellers from the a la carte menu, and this large hot pot filled with flavorful, soft, melty mozzarella cheese as a dip to a warm focaccia have kick start our appetite!

Is there anything more soothing than a bowl of this reach and creamy soup?

It was also nice to add some more greens to balance our plate with a delicious and fresh salad‚Ä¶

This cheesy Prawns Termidor is truly a seafood delight!

I‚Äôve always been a fan of Ribeye Steak, and the tender melt in your mouth of this decadent cut of steak is so worthy of the price!

The salmon skin on top of the dish is so crisp, and the pink fillet is so rich and buttery!

My little spaghetti monster had a full plate of this all for himself!  üòâ

A taste of Filipino-style cheesecake in a richer,creamier, and cheesier way!

Chocolate lovers‚Ä¶ this warm, ooey, gooey chocolate chip cookie topped with vanilla bean ice cream is perfect for you!

Oh dear, we‚Äôve eaten quite a large meal that we ended up stuffed after an indulgent lunch, so we got sleepy and took some siesta time (afternoon nap)!

Then came the evening, a Set Dinner for 2 with a 4-course meal awaited us.

We started off with the Soup of the Day- Asparagus Cream Soup ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs pure comfort in a bowl üòâ

This deliciously succulent Barramundi is made more delectable with butter sauce and served on top of Edamame. I shared this plate with my little boy, and he loved it as well too üôÇ

While the husband enjoyed this juicy and incredibly tender Braised Beef, the little boy liked the taste of the veggie side dish!

Sigh we‚Äôd love to try the Panna Cotta though the restaurant had run out of it.  Instead, we had this sweet and smooth baked custard Creme Flan.

The next day, we were so excited to start the day having an exceptionally good Country Breakfast‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve always believed that when eating a balanced breakfast, you‚Äôll surely have a better morning üòâ

And oh, may I say this in Tagalog, ‚ÄúGustung-gusto ko talaga ang manga!‚Äù  I just love eating mango regardless if it is green or ripe üòâ

Me and my husband got excited as we‚Äôve been served with a warm, thick, bittersweet Tsokolate de Batirol and a perfect pair of Hot Pandesal with Coconut Jam spread.  A variety of freshly baked breads and pastries are so delicious too!

Since we woke up a bit late, we decided to pick the Mains from the Country Breakfast Menu.

My husband had this perfectly marinated tender Beef Tapa that went well with garlic fried rice and fried egg.

‚Ä¶and for myself, it may not be ideal, but I couldn‚Äôt miss not having this all time favorite Filipino breakfast, Garlic Longganisa!

It has been priceless moments to bring our family together over good food and meaningful conversations.

Balinsasayaw Restaurant,4.0,"January 10, 2019",Needs Consistency in Quality & Service,"First time that my family had lunch here was a clear win for a 5-star rating. Everything that we ordered were satisfying and gave us a delightful experience.  That caused us to dine there again, albeit we did not have the same experience.

There were...relatively more customers than our first visit so we just ordered the same combo meals for each for easy preparation and then ordered other dishes ala carte. First disappointment was the waiting time, which is almost 45 minutes. Second was the serving size in which the three got almost the same sizes while mine was obviously only about half of what was served to the rest. Third was the fresh lumpia with my daughter's share having a sour taste.  She tried mine and it tastes different.  They replaced it but with the same sour taste unlike what was served to me which was ok. Then the very disappointing fresh buko which we followed up since our meals were served but we are already about to finish and no fresh buko has arrived.  Calling the waiter for the last time, the waiter said everyone in the kitchen was busy and nobody can prepare the fresh buko for us. But we saw a couple of waiters bringing fresh buko at other tables after I talked to the waiter. 

I demanded that our drinks be replaced with a new one, free of charge, because it was not an issue of being out of stock but an issue of nobody can prepare, meaning it is still available.  The manager gave us free drinks and apologized.

Food is great and gives you value for your money.  But only if they will be consistent in their quality and service.  I am still recommending this restaurant with the hope that they will improve after reading this.",Date of visit:,/ShowUserReviews-g3387417-d4788266-r644851540-Balinsasayaw_Restaurant-Silang_Cavite_Province_Calabarzon_Region_Luzon.html

Siglo Modern Filipino,4.0,"March 26, 2022",A Restaurant That Cares,"Siglo is the in-house restaurant of the charming View Park Hotel.  It prides itself with the use of local ingredients for dishes that hail from Luzon to Mindanao.  We had breakfast here for three days since we were booked at View Park Hotel which included...breakfast in our package.  Breakfast was plated a la carte with rice, eggs and a main viand such as bacon, tapa, daing na bangus, etc.

During our first night, we had dinner at Siglo since we just wanted a quiet & relaxing place to have dinner after a long drive from Manila.  We ordered grilled St. John's fish (Tilapia) with a side dish of tomatoes and onions and fresh young coconut (buko) juice served straight from the coconut.  We enjoyed our meal that we decided to just have dinner there for the next two nights we were in Tagaytay and try their other dishes.  We were not disppointed, in fact we enjoyed the laing and pinakbet that we ordered during the succeeding nights.  

Their serving is good for two persons.  We would order only one dish since the serving was sufficient for the two of us.  Had we ordered another dish there would definitely be left overs.  And we would not have fully enjoyed the savory laing and pinakbet and the grilled tilapia.  

The tilapia was grilled superbly without any signs of blood.  It was juicy and not overly grilled and dry.  The laing had just the right spicy kick without burning your palate and the coconut cream and the yam (gabi) leaves gave the right texture to the dish.  And the pinakbet was a complete dish with mixed vegetables (squash, okra, egg plant,bitter gourd (ampalaya) etc.)and pork bagnet in shrimp paste (bagoong alamang, Ilocanos would usually use anchovy sauce or ginamos).  Each meal with drinks averaged PHP700-800.  We charged our dinners to our room and settled it with a credit card upon checking out of View Park Hotel.

Service was prompt (unlike other reviews mentioning a long wait) probably because since we were booked at View Park Hotel, we placed our orders  two hours before our meal. I think they cook your chosen dish when you order it, thus keeping it fresh.  While waiting for their order, guests could just chit chat or look around and take pictures at the different instagrammable spots of View Park Hotel.  Food attendants were also constantly looking out if we had needs to be attended to.  

While we were dining there, there were only around two other tables that were occupied.  The tables and chairs had that antique feels in keeping up with its name, Siglo.  One table even had an antique sewing machine as its base.  The chairs and benches had hard wood without any cushions so it could be quite a killer on your butt if you wait a long time for your meal.  Probably they could have cushions on some of the chairs so that patrons could choose whether they want to sit on hard wood or on cushioned chairs.

While the dishes were excellent, I feel they have to work a little bit on their beverages.  As previously mentioned, on our first night we had buko juice straight from the coconut.  The juice was refreshing but I felt that the juice came from a matured coconut.  After drinking the juice, we requested that the coconut be broken open so that we could get to the coconut meat.  I was right that the coconut was mature and the meat was not soft and slushy as young coconuts would be.  Perhaps, they should choose their coconuts more judiciously or get a more reliable buko (young coconut) supplier.

On our second night,  we chose to have cucumber shake.   Cucumber is light and refreshing but when it is a shake it becomes a bit heavy and when I sipped the shake about a  fifth of the glass was ice sludge with cucumber residue.  Cucumber juice with kalamansi and honey would have been more satisfying to me.

The service staff professionally attended to the diners.  Rico, the restaurant manager trained his staff well.  In fact, while we were having breakfast, we overheard him emphasizing to the new trainees the value of punctuality.   He said that they should be there fifteen minutes before the appointed time so that they could have a little time to prepare themselves for their shift.

I felt that Rico could probably talk to his staff outside the dining area out of the earshot of diners.  Some diners might misinterpret the training negatively.  But for a training practitioner like me, I felt that the trainees are lucky to have a restaurant manager who is committed and cares to train and guide them.

Overall I would give Siglo a high rating and would endorse it to diners who are in the Tagaytay area for a quiet, relaxing and satisfying meal.",Date of visit:,/ShowUserReviews-g317121-d10587784-r832406943-Siglo_Modern_Filipino-Tagaytay_Cavite_Province_Calabarzon_Region_Luzon.html

Siglo Modern Filipino,4.0,"September 19, 2021",Enjoying local delicacies,"The competition is quite tight in Tagaytay (with so many restaurants and eateries to choose from) and tourists may not know where to go to try some of our very own local dishes. I would personally recommend Siglo Modern Filipino restaurant. The place is a...bit old, but its aged ambiance adds to the beauty of the place. It reminds of our old ancestral house. Anyway, given the restrictions and health protocols nowadays, indoor dining can accommodate only about a dozen people at a time. The menu had a long list of local (Filipino) dishes representing the different regions of the country. I tried their ""bulalo,"" crispy pork ""binagoongan,"" and ""binagoongan rice."" Our order was served some 30mins later. We really didn't mind waiting for we knew that the foods had to be cooked fresh and besides we enjoyed exploring the nearby Siglo Brew caf√© and View Park Hotel in the meantime.

It was when we arrived that I felt the service has gone bad......Without any suggestion and options to offer, that service guy in white polo shirt instantly told me that there is no available/vacant table. Passing by the veranda of this resto, I've seen there are 2 tables that are vacant without ""reserved"" sign on the table. Then that guy in blue polo shirt approached us and asked how many were we. After telling him, he gave us the table outside. Theu could have checked their area first before turning down a customer. üòíüòíüòí

Then, this was the most annoying and i-really-couldnt-accept thing in this place...

Bulalo Point Turo-Turo Grill,4.0,"May 20, 2019",Very popular,"As Bulalo goes, I actually liked the bulalo kare kare more than the special bulalo, but the special bulalo was actually good enough.  There was no more tawilis because of the ban on catching the fish from the lake.  The bangus we had was not...good, as it had a smell.  I believe that is because the bangus came from the lake, which is freshwater.  Bangus from the sea or from a brackish water tastes better.  The rest of our food, like the different veggies: pinakbet, kangkong, etc. were good, same with the blue marlin and the pork based food.

Food: Amazing. We came here for Kare-kare Bulalo and it did not disappoint. Serving is big. It is good for 4-5 persons and has complete vegetable and a generous servings of bulalo meat.

Rowena's Cafe,1.0,"August 29, 2019",Never Again!,"Never Again!
We had a horrible experience here last Sunday May 30, 2019. On our way home from an overnight trip at Tali beach our large group of 10 decided to make a stop in Tagaytay to grab coffee. Our first and 2nd choice were...jam packed so we ended up at cliffhouse and decided to settle here. 

It took a long time for our orders to arrive. I ordered for pansit bihon and white chocolate mocha 16oz. The first batch of coffee we ordered arrived. Then when the waiter called for who ordered white chocolate mocha I raised my hand, but I noticed how come my cup was placed in an 8oz cup when I ordered for 16oz. The waiter seemed annoyed and he told me that for white chocolate mocha the 16oz cup is placed in an 8oz cup. This made no sense to me at all. It was only then that one of my friend said she ordered for the white chocolate mocha small which is the 8oz cup. So I immediately pass the drink to her. All of my friend‚Äôs coffee already arrived except for mine. 

A few minutes later, the waiter came out with a cup of 16oz then he asked who ordered for hot chocolate? I said I ordered for white chocolate mocha 16oz and I did not order for the hot chocolate. And I told the waiter to cancel my WCM. After awhile he came back at our table looking annoyed and was screaming to us saying ‚Äúmeron po talagang nag order nito for Sheila!‚Äù I was shocked that he had to mention my name out loud announcing like I just didn‚Äôt want to accept my order. So I told the waiter, ‚ÄúKuya yes, I am Sheila and I made an order but not for hot chocolate. Why would I accept a wrong order?! Besides, I‚Äôve already cancelled that drink.‚Äù While some of my friends just wanted me to let it slide saying ‚Äúhayaan mo na‚Äù The whole situation got me too annoyed so I said ‚Äúhello? I‚Äôm the paying customer ako pa ba mag aadjust?‚Äù Cliffhouse is known to have quality restaurants and coffee shops within its compound. Not being petty here but, I expect some level of service to go with their menu prices. We noticed, the group from our next table all stood up and left because no one was attending to them. 

The persistent waiter came out again in a few minutes with the 16oz messy cup and putting it down in front of me saying here‚Äôs your white chocolate mocha (ugh! I said to cancel it already) but fine, never mind. I removed the lid to take a sip and my God! It‚Äôs obviously the hot chocolate drink from earlier that they tried to remedy to make it pass as a WCM. I know how a WCM taste like. But to be sure, I passed the drink to my friend who ordered for the same and she confirmed it‚Äôs a different drink. 

When I saw the guy who took our orders coming out of the kitchen, I think he‚Äôs not just an order taker but he was also the one who prepared our food. I immediately called him and I talked to him calmly and told him. Kuya, this isn‚Äôt a WCM. Just to let you know that I am not paying for this drink. The guy told me sure maam no problem and he took the cup away. 

Upset and hungry, I ate my pansit and it tasted like a lot of soy sauce was poured over it. The pansit tasted bad even when I‚Äôm hungry. 

When my friends asked for the bill ‚Äúkuya pa bill out na rin.‚Äù the same waiter responded in his same annoyed tone ‚Äúma‚Äôam wait lang!‚Äù My friend lost it and told him ‚Äú ok kuya! May problema ka ba? Ano bang problema mo? You can say it nicely Ang ayos kung nag ask sayo.!‚Äù I think this waiter can‚Äôt take this level of stress that he doesn‚Äôt realize he‚Äôs already screaming at us numerous times. It‚Äôs a Sunday. Rowena‚Äôs should‚Äôve anticipated the volume of people and should‚Äôve assigned a few more staff that day. Your waiter is so stressed out we are just a group of 10 and the other group already left and they can‚Äôt even cope. 

And my god asking for our bill took another 20 minutes. It was chaos when the lady cashier doesn‚Äôt seem to know what she was doing. Oh and they asked for Sevice charge pa ha. I wanted to ask ‚Äúwhich service?‚Äù But nah, never mind. This will be our first and last to be visiting this place. We should‚Äôve just went to UCC next to it. Sorry no photos. No one would think of taking a photo when the place already ruined everyone‚Äôs mood at the table.",Date of visit:,/ShowUserReviews-g317121-d4102267-r704322883-Rowena_s_Cafe-Tagaytay_Cavite_Province_Calabarzon_Region_Luzon.html

I thought the loooong waiting game is over. 1 hour passed, and only 1 dish was served to our table. They didn't even served us water, which is a common practice in restaurants, that once the guests are seated to their respective tables, the servers will automatically serve a glass of water to their table. (I know that because I am a SHRIM graduate). We noticed that every 30 min, they serve our orders, one by one, which is not sooo good. So all in all, we were waiting for almost 2 hours before we can eat our lunch.",Date of visit:,/ShowUserReviews-g317121-d4102267-r551657422-Rowena_s_Cafe-Tagaytay_Cavite_Province_Calabarzon_Region_Luzon.html

We ordered the Boneless Bangus, Bulalo and Sizzling Gambas..

It took 20mins for our meal to arrive and when it finally reach our table they gave us the biggest and tasties boneless bangus that I have ever seen in my life check out the pic.

The Bulalo is also an absolute winner when they notice that the soup is already half full they will quickly refill the soup, the bulalo meat is also very tender and the vegetable is cooked just right..

I was not able to try tye sizzling gambas because of my allergy to shrimp but according to my wife it's tasty but the serving is not that generous you can clearly see from the pic.. we can buy a lot of prawns with the price of the gambas..

The price is just ok and the service is absolutely awesome.. I will always eat here with no hesitation whenever I'm in tagaytay.

The grilled salmon in the menu were actually salmon belly strips, and I felt grilling them was the wrong way to use it. With all its fat and skin, you barely get any meat. Felt so disappointed because I was imagining a delicately charred salmon fillet.

The banana waffle churos can actually be a full meal in itself unless you intend to share it as a dessert somehow between maybe four people. Service was pretty adequate and their staff was attentive. Price point is okay too.

-their baked potato is heaven
-noticed that their menu items are rich and indulgent so order something acidic to balance things out

Mahogany Market Eateries,5.0,"November 10, 2019",When in Tagaytay... Len's Kitchen!,"I have been to Tagaytay a lot of times, dined at different restaurants, and ordered bulalo every single time. For the past 5 years, and to this date, we still go back to Len's Kitchen at the Mahogany Market Eateries. There are other eateries lined...next to one another but we recommend Len's Kitchen. Not only do you get a full-service experience, but the staff is more than friendly. They are like family members inviting you to eat in their homes. After so many years, we finally met the owner today and she is a lovely and wonderful person, too.

To be honest, you would want to appreciate that the way they serve their bulalo meat. They are in bite sizes, easy to serve among your friends and family, and easy to consume. I also found out that they also take their customers' feedbacks seriously when they started serving the bone marrow (taba) separately so others who are on the ""health-conscious"" side, and you can simply ask one of the staff for the bone marrow which they will serve separately. 

Budget-wise, definitely affordable. To be honest, generally speaking, when talking about the cost to dine, it will actually depend on what you order. We have paid around P700 for 4 people, and sometimes for two (depends on how hungry we all are.. haha). But again, in general, the place is budget-friendly. Free refill of soup and veggies, free coffee after meals, seasonal fruits (when available).

I was told that they also serve breakfast. :)

So when you are in Tagaytay, this is a must-visit!

I could see bulalo precooked on display, which is a concern for freshness.  I eventually settled down to one of the eatery and ordered their bulalo.  It was served in like 5 minutes, even though they said they have a new batch.  The meat wasn't that tender, and the soup was plain clear soup with petchay. The bone marrow was breaking apart, which is another sign that is not fresh, and overcooked meat.
