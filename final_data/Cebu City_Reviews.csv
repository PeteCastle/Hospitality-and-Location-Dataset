552,The Oriental Spice Gourmet,Cebu City,5.0,"November 24, 2019",Tasty food,"We were having quite some time choosing what to order so the owner of the store helped us out. She recommended all that we ate and knew how much we could finish given the questions she asked and what we answered. She was very accommodating,...and authentic. 

The food served to us were spicy beef, pad thai, spring rolls, roti, and broccoli & cauliflower mix vegetables. The beef was so tender, just the way I liked it and its sauce was incredibly very tasty despite being spicy (I‚Äôm not a fan of spicy food). Roti dipped to its sauce was a good mix. The noodle Pad Thai was also good, a bit of variation from the usual Pad Thai I know but still it was good. For dessert we ordered, cream cheese and since I like my food sour it was heaven for me. üòÅ Their cream cheese seemed to be drizzled with a bit of calamansi juice. üëç

Place is quite small but I think could accommodate 50pax at max. The store is a first come first serve basis so if you plan to visit and you‚Äôre a big group, I suggest you call in advance to make a reservation.

Store is only open around lunch time to dinner time and is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays.",Date of visit:,/ShowUserReviews-g298461-d6778693-r728529127-The_Oriental_Spice_Gourmet-Lapu_Lapu_Mactan_Island_Cebu_Island_Visayas.html,restaurant,,,,,

602,Feria,Cebu City,1.0,"November 24, 2022",Bad. Awful. Terrible. Disappointing. Dreadful. ,"We went to Faria restaurant because it was listed as number 1 on Tripadvisor. 
We saw the buffet and the a la carte menu seemed better. Buffet is 2200 peso pp and for a vegetarian it wasn't worth it. For the a la carte, we...had to sit in the lobby lounge area with a low table and deep sofas so it was difficult to eat comfortably even though there were plenty of free seats in the restaurant. Many things on the menu weren't available and the waitress was going back and forth to check things with the kitchen. My husband's curry was tiny and my tofu dish had far too much tofu and little veg it wasn't nice. Service was ABSOLUTELY terrible. It took forever to ask for the bill, the waitress took our card for payment and didn't return for a while. I walked to the bar area to ask what was happening. Our card was just sitting behind the bar and the barman just replied saying he needed a signature. I told him we've been waiting and worried about where our card was.

The Radisson is tucked away in its own complex so getting a grab taxi back to our hotel was impossible. The security guard found us a taxi and we paid more than what we paid to the hotel but we were happy to be out of the Radisson Blu. 

I wholly wouldn't recommend Faria restaurant. You can find better service, cheaper and nicer food elsewhere. For such a large hotel hosting many guests, there weren't enough staff making the service not expected for a five star hotel.",Date of visit:,/ShowUserReviews-g298460-d1914947-r869557257-Feria-Cebu_City_Cebu_Island_Visayas.html,restaurant,,,,,

613,Abaca Restaurant,Cebu City,5.0,"February 5, 2019",Best restaurant at Cebu,"We are staying at Abaca resort so , it‚Äôs the best choice for us. 

I stayed at Shangri-La , Cebu , Amanpulo , Philippine before and had tried many fine restaurants at Manila , Abaca restaurant is the best one comparing to all of other...restaurants that I tried in Philippine . 

Breadfast is included in room rate . Guests can order anything in the menu , everything were yummy. I especially like English Breadfast ,the pancakes were like a birthday cake size and super yummy . They provided the biggest croissants that I have ever have. 
They prepared for us and ready at 3:30 am  the sandwiches was five stars quality !  

For lunch and dinner, 2/3 food on the menu were very good. I particularly recommand  the beef with flat spaghetti noodles , the steak for two was excellent too, seafood and grilled prawn spaghetti was very good too. Seafood soup was good but not excellent ( fish could be better but the taste of the soup was really good) , fried rib  was good but could be better, please don‚Äôt order pork belly if you were Chinese , it‚Äôs tasteless to me, Chinese pork belly is thousand times better . Duck breast was overdone and I do not recommand too! 

But you must order cream br√ªl√©e which maybe the best one i had ever had and it‚Äôs huge in portion! ( I ordered twice, first time was better than second, because the crispy caramelised sugar of cream br√ªl√©e at the second time was too thick and too burned). 
Besides, the environment and service is excellent , highly recommand even you are not staying at this resort!

It is a beautiful restaurant with the mood...set completely right, the staff is as always courteous and well trained, as what you expect by now from an abaca establishment. However where the restaurant fell short unexpectedly was the food. 

The appetizers were outstanding with mussels as well as calamari. But when the time came for the main courses, it all fell flat. The food tasted like what you get in most restaurants here, the short ribs were good but uninteresting in every way. My client had the prawn spaghetti and him as well were unimpressed with the blandness of his food. For the price we pay and the expectations we had we were disappointing in the food experience. I for one who visited the other Abaca restaurant expected more. I guess that was the mistake when first visiting, having too high expectations, but its hard not having high expectations on the food when you pay top prices and expect the food to be such as well.",Date of visit:,/ShowUserReviews-g298461-d1205918-r644851380-Abaca_Restaurant-Lapu_Lapu_Mactan_Island_Cebu_Island_Visayas.html,restaurant,,,,,

It was a Saturday night so I assumed it would be relatively quiet compared with the working week.
BUT.
It was obvious there had been no management of the alcohol a party of 4 had consumed. They were drunk (I quote a...Pig & Palm employee), vulgar and loud.
A vegetable course was served along with a starter course.
My 2nd vegetable course came on its own and was totally inedible. The carrots had been cooked so badly there was neither crunch nor taste left in them added to this was the overpowering sweet sauce poured over them.
My main course did not happen as I lost interest after waiting 14 minutes.
I‚Äôve been delighted with the ambiance, food & service on prior visits so what has happened?

Let me tell you about my favorite when it comes to solving my Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cravings: Shawarma Gourmet! This place is my go-to spot whenever my taste buds scream for some exotic flavors.

Situated at Escario Central, Shawarma Gourmet is a...paradise for anyone who loves good food. And let me tell you, it's not just about their mouthwatering Shawarma. Nope! They've got a whole array of amazing dishes like Hummus, Kibbeh, Tabbouleh, Sambousek, Baklava, Falafel, Baba Ganoush, and more. It's like stepping into a Middle Eastern feast!

Oh, and those breads! They're just wow! Freshly baked and oh-so-delicious. They perfectly complement every dish they serve.

Now, here's the exciting part! They've added platters to their menu, and that includes the Khabsa tray. It's a match made in take-out heaven! Perfect for those times when you want to indulge in their flavors from the comfort of your home.

If you're planning to visit with a group of friends or family, trust me, their Manakish or Lebanese Pizza is a surefire crowd-pleaser. Everyone's taste buds will thank you!

The best part, though, is the owners. They're the friendliest people you'll ever meet! Their warm hospitality makes the whole experience even better. You'll feel like part of their food-loving family.

First, the buffet is really pricey for mediocre food quality. Choices were not that much. I've been to other less pricey buffets that served something much better. The only positive thing I could write about it is probably their staff who were very courteous and accommodating. I wish they'd hire better chefs and improve their food quality.

We had previously showed up on a Sunday no reservation and expected to be accommodated. For reference we have spent a lot of money at this place pre and post pandemic. We are good for taking home baked goods and me personally I am a general 20% tipper. The last time we showed up only one table occupied in the air conditioned part of the place and nobody was outside. We asked for a table was shown a glass topped table which never would have worked for our two year old. I asked for another table told it was reserved I asked for two tables to be put together was told no. I could not believe the gall of the staff. We left in a hurry myself very loudly cursing the place. How do you fail to accommodate a somewhat regular customer ? Well they do not get a chance for a redeux. Last time I was there our waitress got 1000 peso tip were she there the Sunday we were not given a table I am sure she would have intervened. Sadly I will never patronize this restaurant again.

I asked the waiter why the sauce was bright yellow his only response was that it was classic carbonara. Obviously he had no idea how to respond to my question and no idea what carbonara looks like. I have had this dish hundreds of times in restaurants and never seen anything like that. My daughter said it tasted like a bad version of Mac ‚Äòn cheese.

Ms Belle from Restaurant Reservation Desk for being so responsive on my emails. Being so helpful from the reservation phase up to the day of the reservation itself. Without you mam, i wont...feel as relaxed as I was. For all your help, thank you so much

Mr. Jeffrie from Cowrie Cove Restaurant who assisted us tirelessly throughout the night. Me and my girlfriend enjoyed his enthusiasm for his work and made us feel so welcome. We are lucky and happy to have him serve us our lovely dinner. Thank you for all your help sir :)

Set-up: kudos to shangrila mactan, it is everything I expected. Everything is picturesque. From the entrance up to the venue itself. Me and my girlfriend enjoyed every step we took. The ambience of the whole place is romantic and dreamy.

Food: we availed of the 5 course meal to be served in the observatory of the restaurant. 

We loved it. From appetizers down to desserts. 

5 out of 5. The staff, specially ms belle and mr jeffrie, heavily contributed to this rating. I believe that aside from the taste of the food itself, it is very important for the guests to feel at ease and to be surrounded by happy people to fully enjoy the food and the experience.

myself to something special, my favorite spot is the Cowrie Cove at the Shangri-La resort on Mactan Island, in Cebu. 

I love the Shangri-La resort because it's the friendliest place...I have found in this area, so far. They have good but discrete security. Every staff member
is well-trained, professional and will greet you with a smile. 

They have at least 5 restaurants that I 
know of, but my favorite is the Cowrie Cove, which is right on the beach, with a spectacular view. The bar 2 for 1 at happy hour (5-7 pm), but then you simply MUST make a reservation for dinner in the dining area after you enjoy your drinks.

They try to roll out the red carpet for every guest and make you feel very special. Chef Marvin, the maestro in the kitchen will bend over backwards to satisfy your particular culinary need and desires.

So-so taste wise and portions on the smaller size.

Service was attentive but then again, nothing over the top.

One thing is for sure, be prepared to pay at this restaurant; dinner for 10 of us was well over PHP 40,000 and we were not drinking expensive wines.

When...we walked in, the staff were all welcoming and made us feel at home. My husband and I both love Spanish/tapas and excited to try the menu. We started with the trios: the Jamon Serrano, chorizo Iberico and Jamon Iberico and didn‚Äôt disappoint our palate. When in Cebu, must try their local lechon so we ordered the Cebu lechon tacos and it has the crunchiness I expected from a lechon and the rest just melt in your mouth. The main course was the Paella Negra and it was perfect, not salty (it can be tricky since the squid ink can be salty if not done properly), the squid was tender not tough and the scallop was not over cooked, just right. We  had the Churros con chocolate for dessert (we were so full by the time for dessert otherwise we would have ordered the coconut panna cotta also), it was excellent!

Overall, the food is excellent, staff are friendly and very attentive, the price is right,

Don‚Äôt forget the drinks, I had the traditional sangria and gone before the main course arrived (that good) and ordered a glass of Chardonnay and then there was the ‚Äúwelcome to Cebu‚Äù drink and it was nice and not too sweet.

The prawns on the skewers were grilled to perfection and coated in a beautiful garlic butter. Other prawns we ordered were cooked in a dreamy, creamy sauce which made you reach for the rice after the prawns were gone to soak it up. The pork belly was great too.

The staff were efficient and helpful and its a really big place so even though we went at peak time on a Sunday night room was found for us in their airconditioned back section.

Food tastes great for a reasonable price:
1. Lechon tastes good but Id still prefer Rico's, Ayer's or even Elar's. Just a 4/5
2. Utan Bisaya tastes good but too salty for us. Also, didn't like the blackish...colored soup. If I may suggest, use danggit instead of ginamos. This is a 3/5.
3. Chinese Ngohiong tastes great. 4.5/5
4. Grillef Chorizo is a 5!
5. Rice in Caldero is a 5!
6. Kinilaw Tanigue is a 4/5. For me it lacks vinegar.

Place is a 4.5/5:
1. I like the native Vibe, spacious place and comfy chairs.
2. Location is very accessible as it's near Ayala.
3. Gravel parking gets muddy during rainy days. They should have cemented it. This is something to improve on.

860,House of Lechon,Cebu City,5.0,"July 11, 2023",A Great Birthday Celebration,"We returned after five years since our first visit and the review below. Impressive. The general public is also voting with its feet: demand is so high the restaurant has had to institute a reservation system but the good news is this works well. Our...visit was on a Monday evening too when the norm might be for restaurants to be  quieter than more obvious days. When we arrived the restaurant was heaving; in view of this demand we were put onto the waiting list and able to sit down in a designated area as well as being advised that 'lechon', the main attraction, was 'on hold', meaning it might not be available when we came to order. I like this openness, I like it very much! In the event we were able to order 3/4 kg of standard lechon which hit the spot with some very crisp crackling or 'chicharron' as the locals call it. We filled this out with a fine piece of barbecued tuna, Cebu Express, a delicious creamy vegetarian take on the famous Bihol express, mixed vegetables and yummy garlic rice; we washed this lot down with some deliciously flavoured kalamansi (lime) juice and the kids had equally drinkable iced tea. Oh and as a family we were celebrating two birthdays which straddled three days: we were touched by the staff's traditional rendition of Happy Birthday and some luscious puto bongbong cheesecake. In chatting with our waiter we learned the restaurant has a new chef who has revamped all the menus. Judging on the demand it's all a success story. Our only gripe would be the time it took to process payment via our card: this triggered some fears especially when it was returned with a paid receipt without a signature or authorisation code being required. So a great birthday celebration! Many thanks and hopefully we'll be back sooner next time!",Date of visit:,/ShowUserReviews-g298460-d10146222-r902076428-House_of_Lechon-Cebu_City_Cebu_Island_Visayas.html,restaurant,,,,,

They did make eye contact, but if they were not the ones taking the orders, they should have called someone else to attend to us. Ignoring us due to the big number of customers around is not an excuse. SECOND, the lechon was terrible. I had high expectations of this place after my visits before. I even brought my family now even if the restaurant was out of our way. But the lechon did not taste good and the skin was not crispy at all. The lechon from the markets in Cebu tastes even better. You should do some quality control. Or change your name because it‚Äôs not appropriate to call it ‚ÄúHouse of Lechon‚Äù when the star of your restaurant is the other food in the menu and not the lechon.

The worst part was, he was arrogant when we asked him, and he even pointed the blame on us, claiming the kids were noisy and he repeated it to me several times (obviously not coz you got it wrong, i even mistakenly pointed out the boneless lechon solo on the menu which he corrected me and said it was just a 1 person meal order and turn the page to the right one.)

377,Mandarin Plaza Hotel,Cebu City,4.0,,"Great price, great area!",We stayed at the Mandarin Plaza for 3 nights at the end of our trip to Philippines. We booked two rooms and they were on the 16th floor. The views were great and it was very quiet.   Beds were comfortable and the rooms were really clean. A lot of the TV channels were not working so we were limited in what we could watch however the wifi was sufficient and we could utilise our phones for entertainment.   Breakfast was good however a little expensive if it is not included in your room.   We paid an extra 1000php per night for an extra trundle bed and then an extra 50% of the room rate for late checkout of 6pm due to a late airport departure.   The staff were very lovely and accommodating. Location is very close to the Ayala Centre and we walked there in less than 5 minutes.,March 2023,/ShowUserReviews-g298460-d4610789-r883887955-Mandarin_Plaza_Hotel-Cebu_City_Cebu_Island_Visayas.html,hotel,Mar 2023,,,,

The entrance fee is 70 Pesos (As of May 2023). Expect a crowd and patience is a virtue if you want to have a picture with the famous golden hand. Actually, there's four of it. There are two huge golden hands, and two small ones. Since the line is quite long for the huge golden hands, I decided to just take a picture with the small ones as we still have another destination that day. I stood in line for almost 20 mins and yet, I'm not even close. Some takes more than 10 minutes in taking pictures. So imagine that? More than 10 minutes per person. During our time, most of the visitors are foreign, you can count with your hands how many are the Filipinos in line. I highly suggest that you make this as your last destination so you can spend all the time here and you won't have to hurry because you still have another place to go but it would be much better if there's someone who facilitates to ensure that a guest won't spend too much time to consider also there are a lot of other guests waiting for their turn.
