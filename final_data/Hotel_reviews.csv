I was then informed that the rooms on each floor ending with 39 are the largest rooms. Therefore, I strongly recommend you reserve those if possible (as long as I don't miss out as a consequence!).

The 1775 Adriatico place is misadvertised and worse than any good reviews written about it. It’s quaintly located in an alley in one of the worst part of Manila. On making the Booking.com reservation, being foreigners, we were unaware and misled by the illustrated descriptive advertisement. It’s ideal for couples renting per the hour, wanting a quickie. Although the towels were clean, they were stained, thin and low quality. It does have two bathrooms with shower but looks unsanitary.

The executive suite bathroom's shower caddy was missing, so had to put the bath gel, shampoo, etc on the floor.

Being situated right by a variety of key places of interest that for me make this hotel perfectly situated. Firstly you are close to the Manila Bay beach and that makes a huge difference. The space and open water can really give you a welcome break from the busy and frantic streets of a very chaotic city. Secondly you have the lovely Rizal Park right by the hotel. Again it’s so wonderful to be able to walk in the park and enjoy this valuable green space. Then the most wonderful attraction is the incredible Intramuros district that is close by.

Eurotel Pedro Gil,2.0,Feb 2022,Quarantine stay,"Stayed for mandatory quarantine. The 2 stars are for the friendly staff. The hotel facilities are really poor. The room smells and looks dusty, sheets has stains (even the newly washed ones that i asked for the staff). Water smells rusty too. No window at all so it’s very depressing when you’re staying for quarantine and can’t go out. No electric kettle but can request a liter of hot water from the receptionist for 10pesos. The packed meals has a very small portion too, mostly fried viands, and no vege at all. Even the hotel’s menu (if you want to order) has a very limited selection. As i can remember, there were only 3 kinds of vege salads and that’s it. To think they dont allow food deliveries so sana dagdagan ang menu like chopsuey or something.",January 2022,/ShowUserReviews-g298573-d1175684-r829314778-Eurotel_Pedro_Gil-Manila_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html

Good thing the mall is just around the corner so i can easily buy food. The guard took care of my car tho, so thats a plus.

The staff were very sweet, particularly some of the gentlemen in the lobby and the lovely lady who checked me in at night. I feel bad that I forgot to note her name. Maybe Annette?

The most concerning problem, was the presence of black mold in the room, likely due to a ceiling leak. Not only did this raise health concerns, but it also made us question the hotel's cleanliness and maintenance practices.

View Park Hotel,5.0,Apr 2023,A WELL SPENT ANNIVERSARY VACATION,"My husband and I recently celebrated our 11th anniversary last March 26,2023, so we travel to Tagaytay in order to relax and escape the strains of daily life. Due to our extreme exhaustion after the day's travel, we decided to stay in a hotel after visiting some of Tagaytay's well-known tourist attractions and restaurants. Then we came across the View Park Hotel Tagaytay when looking for a place to stay, and in my opinion, that was the best decision we could have made. When you are dropped off in front of the hotel, a very approachable security guard will be the first to help you, followed by the warm and welcoming front desk agent and manager who, the entire time I was asking questions, were smiling and happy to respond.

Hotel Casiana Tagaytay,4.0,14 Aug,Has its pros and cons,"Pros:  * Clean and well-maintained rooms (we booked a 3-bedroom and deluxe family) and common spaces (e.g. lobby, pool area, dining area) * 3-bedroom executive suite has a spacious master’s bedroom and second room.  The third room isn’t as big, but can still comfortably sleep 2 guests (I believe it has a full bed). * Professional, pleasant staff who sets the tone for a good stay. * TV in every room plus an air purifier unit. * Clean, heated pool. * Our late checkout was accommodated.  Cons:  * In most places, when you book a suite, you can expect a decent view.  Ours was located on the 6th floor of a 9- or 10-floor building and overlooks the parking lot and the road.  You can see the mountains beyond, but the foreground view just ruins it..  * En suite bathroom is tiny.  * Their",August 2023,/ShowUserReviews-g317121-d23027720-r910412268-Hotel_Casiana_Tagaytay-Tagaytay_Cavite_Province_Calabarzon_Region_Luzon.html

Hotel Casiana Tagaytay,4.0,Jul 2023,Great staff and a very cozy place for the family,"Everything turn out great with this fine gem at the heart of Tagaytay. The only thing that bothered us was the heated pool. We booked our stay here because our kids (ages 4 and 1) would like to swim using the heated pool. To our dismay, the pool was not heated and we are not advised that it was not heated. I called the guest services and spoke to several people over the phone prior to us going to the pool area, but no one mentioned that the pool was not heated. The pool personnel told us, after using the pool, that the heater was ""under maintenance"". Our kids does not want to swim anymore since the water was too cold and that we said that it will be a heated pool as advertised.

However, this time we were assigned a garden view room that was quite dilapidated, the bathroom fixtures were loose and very old, room amenities were lacking, and the room exterior looked unkempt.

The revamped restaurant, Farmer's Table (operated by a third party, Raintree) is ridiculously expensive, and the food is bland, tasteless and ordinary. The plated breakfast was so-so.

The Carmelence View,1.0,Nov 2021,Misleading Listing and Poor Service,"I don't like leaving negative reviews and usually do not. And I will preface this by saying, if the hotel treated their guests right, I may have let this go, but I can't.  The place is nice enough. The room was spacious and clean when we got there. The listing clearly stated that there is a bathtub in the room which is one of the filters we used in finding a room given this was quite a drive.   There was no bathtub. Worse, when I went to the desk to complain, the staff admitted it was their mistake for not keeping the listing updated, but there was no apology (maybe because I kept calm?) He said, there are no other rooms available so they can't give me a room with a bathtub. I was told that they only have rooms with tubs listed on their direct booking site and not on Agoda...uh",November 2021,/ShowUserReviews-g317121-d10140135-r819140118-The_Carmelence_View-Tagaytay_Cavite_Province_Calabarzon_Region_Luzon.html

Without precaution it will be hard to see the gate because it is just an ordinary gate with a dim entrance due to lots of trees on both sides.

But upon entering our assigned room (FAmily Room) everything became a wow.  The long table was perfect for a family to sit on whole day and night for kwentuhan sessions.

Webs in every corner, the floor was very dirty. Seems like they didn't swipe it for months.

The breakfast is already cold so its not delicious. And this place is far from the tourist spots in tagaytay coz its almost near to nasugbu, batangas.

I can say YES because they have the best team that offers high standard of service. From the time your car pull in, and when you are helped with your luggages, to checking in, waiting for the rooms and until you are escorted to your room - well done!

Escala Tagaytay,5.0,May 2023,Good hotel with breathtaking views,"We stayed two (2) nights at Escala whiile in Tagaytay for a wedding.    As we approached the hotel it was obvious that COVID 19 had adversly affected extension plans with build stopped next to Escala's carpark and the Pavilion Escala (wedding venue) apparently temporarily closed.  However this does not seem to have affected the Hotel itself.  On entry to the hotel the first thing you notice is the oustanding view from the foyer across Taal Lake to Taal volcano in the distance.  The view is absolutely amazing. Even though there were numerous people checking in or checking out, the process was simple and quick.  We were shown to our room by an attentive staff member.   We chose a deluxe suite and were so glad we did, the view from our room (211) looked across the pool and out over",April 2023,/ShowUserReviews-g317121-d11871093-r890847509-Escala_Tagaytay-Tagaytay_Cavite_Province_Calabarzon_Region_Luzon.html

Summit Ridge Tagaytay,4.0,3 Aug,Ideal Staycation Hotel on a budget,"The first thing that comes to mind is the beautiful view of Taal Lake/Volcano, especially if you're staying at the top floors. It was raining when we last stayed there so the weather was cozy when you go outside the room. In terms of convenience, there's a supermarket, and a few restaurants within walking distance so it's perfect if you just plan to stay in the room all day.

Summit Ridge Tagaytay,2.0,Jul 2023,Bad experience on staff,Stayed here for 2 nights. We had a bad experience on rude behavior from their staff at parking lot. Though it would have been okay except for the rude staff na pinaalis kami sa parking na sinabing okay lang mag park ng isa pang staff. I have no issue in moving kung sinabi lang sana ng maayos. We reported it at the reception unfortunately no action taken.  Room and view was very nice though. But I will not recommend to stay here on rainy days since open area yung papunta sa rooms basang basa din yung daan doon sa hallway papuntang room.  You will not be able to access their internet at 4am looks like they're turning it off which is weird.,June 2023,/ShowUserReviews-g317121-d1485031-r906542559-Summit_Ridge_Tagaytay-Tagaytay_Cavite_Province_Calabarzon_Region_Luzon.html

Hotel Casiana Tagaytay,4.0,14 Aug,Has its pros and cons,"Pros:  * Clean and well-maintained rooms (we booked a 3-bedroom and deluxe family) and common spaces (e.g. lobby, pool area, dining area) * 3-bedroom executive suite has a spacious master’s bedroom and second room.  The third room isn’t as big, but can still comfortably sleep 2 guests (I believe it has a full bed). * Professional, pleasant staff who sets the tone for a good stay. * TV in every room plus an air purifier unit. * Clean, heated pool. * Our late checkout was accommodated.  Cons:  * In most places, when you book a suite, you can expect a decent view.  Ours was located on the 6th floor of a 9- or 10-floor building and overlooks the parking lot and the road.

Three masseuse attended to each one of us and worked their way in massaging us.   It was pretty average type of massage -- I mean -- there were no relaxing diffusers or candles to set the mood.

The Carmelence View,2.0,20 Aug,Satisfactory,"Pros: the view is spectacular and the staff are extremely courteous. Unlimited complimentary coffee and tea (during the duration of the stay) + pastries (just one-time upon check-in)  Cons: the place doesn’t have a signage but I was told that this is deliberate as they don’t entertain walk-ins.

The Carmelence View,5.0,Feb 2023,Best room view of Taal Volcano,"I stumbled upon this hotel in Facebook. I checked the reviews and they were satisfactory. Hence, we booked a room for 4 persons and given the Mid Pines Suite 1. Getting to the hotel we were a bit lost. We did not see any signage to lead us to The Carmelence View. We entered the The Carmelence Lodge which was across it because it had a signage. Only to find out that you have to enter a driveway to lead you to The Carmelence View. This was the only letdown in our stay. It would be better if the hotel had a sign especially for first timers.  As we entered the driveway, we saw some old house structures and felt eerie if this would be the hotel. As we moved further along we found the parking and the foyer as you move up to the property.

Door was hard to close, bathroom ceiling was full of mildew, shower head was large but the water sprinkled all over the place. Bathroom door doesn’t have a lock and it was hard to open and close.  Wall mirrors in the bedroom were stained with black spots. Bed was comfortable but bed sheet had a very visible tear/hole. Blinds to block sunlight were also stained with mildew.

The listing clearly stated that there is a bathtub in the room which is one of the filters we used in finding a room given this was quite a drive.   There was no bathtub. Worse, when I went to the desk to complain, the staff admitted it was their mistake for not keeping the listing updated, but there was no apology (maybe because I kept calm?)

Tagaytay Hotel Sixb,2.0,Dec 2022,Uncomfortable & Frustrating Stay in Tagaytay.,"Had an overnight stay with my family. The bedroom that the hotel gave us had 3 double beds but one of the beds was not comfortable enough to sleep with. Itchy rashes appear on my legs after a few minutes of using the blanket, and a continous sneezes which is not good to an asthmatic like me.  As a result, we ended up using only 2 beds. 4 consumable bottled water was also in the room but 2 were already unsealed.

It came to a point that I decided to just shut off the aircon. When we mentioned about it at the Front Office and pointed out why the room was still released to a paying guest, I was told that I should have complained earlier. Considering that we checked in at around midnight and planned to leave by around 8:30 AM, I wonder if they expected us to go down at 3:30 AM to request for a room transfer. Apparently, they are aware that aircon was not working well and yet they still booked us in that room.
