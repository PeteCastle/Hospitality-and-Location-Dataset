We spent our dinner yesterday celebrating the occasion of my loved one at Medley Buffet at Okada and they showed us unbelievable service. Why? Because the food was outstanding and the staff were very friendly and accommodating.

We...visited a lot of buffet restaurants in a several city's but this one is very calming and relaxing, not to mention the perfect view of the sunset.

I must say that everything was excellent. I wasn't expecting that this occasion would be perfect as planned.

How should I ever forget this? We were surprised when the chef delivered us a plate of  Japanese Shashimi. We have Singaporean and buttered-style lobsters served on our table. He even offered us if we liked a baked lobster. The result is amazing as we tasted one of a Michelin star cuisines. Kudos chefs! 

Our sincerest thanks for the surprise song with the matching cake ‚ù§Ô∏è it means a lot to us since we are away from our family to celebrate this special day.

And lastly, I would like to express my gratitude especially to Ms. Jecka and Mr. Paul for providing me and my partner with a tremendous experience that we will never forget!  Not everyone is hands-on like you. You are both truly a gem that should be treasured. Your smiles never disappear from your faces every time you assist us.

Thankfully, they accommodated our Signature Menu orders.

As mentioned, we were celebrating two occasions but it did not feel as special celebrating it in The Peak.

This was located on the 60th floor of Hyatt...BGC, and you have to take a separate elevator going to the rooftop, even if you‚Äôre a hotel guest. 

Food was amazing, and seeing them being prepared over the open concept kitchen was and added an entertaining element to it.  The appetizers, the slain dishes all the way to the dessert was very satisfying. 

Service was impressive, in spite of the busy atmosphere and time (weekend) and we felt very well attended for sure! 

The ambiance, being in the rooftop, was of course, super nice. I heard the view is amazing but it was the patio was closed at that time we went due to a bad weather.",Date of visit:,/ShowUserReviews-g1758900-d15580114-r905563437-The_Peak-Taguig_City_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html,restaurant,,,,,

Stepping foot in this hotel feels like time traveling. The last I had been here was in 2013 and nothing has changed since then.  We booked the classic superior room. The room was clean, spacious, had basic amenities, and a bathtub. The furnitures and fixtures need some upgrade though.   Room service was a bit slow and the phone line was mostly busy. We had to call twice for bathrobes and towels which they forgot to put in the room.  We went here on a holiday so it was probably not the best time considering the crowd in the pools and jacuzzi. The bar by the pool was also closed but there was a phone you could call in and order.  There was no breakfast included with the booking so we ordered ala carte",April 2023,/ShowUserReviews-g298573-d306011-r890431697-Century_Park_Hotel-Manila_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html,hotel,May 2023,,,,

966,National Museum Of Anthropology,Manila,1.0,,If you are rich enough to waste 3 hours of your day!,"The information people expect to see in this museum is far from what you really get once you start the tour. You will mostly read who the donor is, who sponsored which arts and paintings.  Mostly, the arts and paintings you see are newly made out of recycled materials. Locals were so loud and only took their photos from the entrance to the stairways, hallways without any consideration that there were other people in the building.  Kids running playing around. The museum itself is not informative. I'm deeply disappointed and felt so embarrassed üò≥ about ignorance and narcissism of some.",Dec 2022,/ShowUserReviews-g298573-d11796928-r872995401-National_Museum_Of_Anthropology-Manila_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html,tourist_sites,,/Profile/737marisal,Marisa L,Couples,",27 December 2022"
